2023,global mining footprint mapped from high-resolution satellite imagery,"mining is of major economic, environmental and societal consequence, yet knowledge and understanding of its global footprint is still limited. here, we produce a global mining land use dataset via remote sensing analysis of high-resolution, publicly available satellite imagery. the dataset comprises 74,548 polygons, covering ~66,000 km2 of features like waste rock dumps, pits, water ponds, tailings dams, heap leach pads and processing/milling infrastructure. our polygons finely contour the edges of mine features and do not include the space between them. this distinguishes our dataset from others that employ broader definitions of mining lands. hence, despite our database being the largest to date by number of polygons, comparisons show relatively lower global land use. our database is made freely available to support future studies of global mining impacts. a series of spatial analyses are also presented that highlight global mine distribution patterns and broader environmental risks. © 2023, the author(s).","global mining footprint mapped from high-resolution satellite imagery mining is of major economic, environmental and societal consequence, yet knowledge and understanding of its global footprint is still limited. here, we produce a global mining land use dataset via remote sensing analysis of high-resolution, publicly available satellite imagery. the dataset comprises 74,548 polygons, covering ~66,000 km2 of features like waste rock dumps, pits, water ponds, tailings dams, heap leach pads and processing/milling infrastructure. our polygons finely contour the edges of mine features and do not include the space between them. this distinguishes our dataset from others that employ broader definitions of mining lands. hence, despite our database being the largest to date by number of polygons, comparisons show relatively lower global land use. our database is made freely available to support future studies of global mining impacts. a series of spatial analyses are also presented that highlight global mine distribution patterns and broader environmental risks. © 2023, the author(s).",1,water,0.8889025449752808
2023,soil phosphorus availability and fractionation in response to different phosphorus sources in alkaline and acid soils: a short-term incubation study,"using agricultural wastes as an alternative phosphorus (p) source has great prospects to improve soil p status. a 70-day incubation experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of superphosphate (ssp), poultry manure (pm), cattle manure (cm), maize straw (ms), and cattle bone meal (cb) with the same total p input on soil p availability and fractions in typical acidic (red soil) and alkaline (fluvo-aquic soil) soils. the results showed that in both fluvo-aquic and red soils, cm out-performed other p sources in improving soil p availability. changes in soil olsen-p (δolsen-p) were greater in fluvo-aquic soils with ssp, pm and cm additions than in red soils. among the different p sources used, only cm has increased the labile soil p fractions to levels similar to that with ssp. compared with ssp, more monoester p and inositol hexakisphosphate were detected in soils amended with pm and cm. a structural equation model (sem) analysis suggested that soil ph had a direct positive effect on the labile p fractions in the acidic red soil amended with different p sources. in summary, cm is a superior p source for increasing plant available soil p, with considerable practical implications for p recycling. © 2023, the author(s).","soil phosphorus availability and fractionation in response to different phosphorus sources in alkaline and acid soils: a short-term incubation study using agricultural wastes as an alternative phosphorus (p) source has great prospects to improve soil p status. a 70-day incubation experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of superphosphate (ssp), poultry manure (pm), cattle manure (cm), maize straw (ms), and cattle bone meal (cb) with the same total p input on soil p availability and fractions in typical acidic (red soil) and alkaline (fluvo-aquic soil) soils. the results showed that in both fluvo-aquic and red soils, cm out-performed other p sources in improving soil p availability. changes in soil olsen-p (δolsen-p) were greater in fluvo-aquic soils with ssp, pm and cm additions than in red soils. among the different p sources used, only cm has increased the labile soil p fractions to levels similar to that with ssp. compared with ssp, more monoester p and inositol hexakisphosphate were detected in soils amended with pm and cm. a structural equation model (sem) analysis suggested that soil ph had a direct positive effect on the labile p fractions in the acidic red soil amended with different p sources. in summary, cm is a superior p source for increasing plant available soil p, with considerable practical implications for p recycling. © 2023, the author(s).",0,soil,0.9789943695068359
2023,engineered mineralogical interfaces as radionuclide repositories,"effective capture of fugitive actinides and daughter radionuclides constitutes a major remediation challenge at legacy or nuclear accident sites globally. the ability of double-layered, anionic clay minerals known as hydrotalcites (htc) to contemporaneously sequester a range of contaminants from solution offers a unique remedy. however, htc do not provide a robust repository for actinide isolation over the long term. in this study, we formed htc by in-situ precipitation in a barren lixiviant from a uranium mine and thermally transformed the resulting radionuclide-laden, nanoscale htc. atomic-scale forensic examination of the amorphized/recrystallised product reveals segregation of u to nanometre-wide mineral interfaces and the local formation of interface-hosted mineral grains. this u-phase is enriched in rare earth elements, a geochemical analogue of actinides such as np and pu, and represents a previously unreported radionuclide interfacial segregation. u-rich phases associated with the mineral interfaces record a u concentration factor of ~ 50,000 relative to the original solute demonstrating high extraction and concentration efficiencies. in addition, the co-existing host mineral suite of periclase, spinel-, and olivine-group minerals that equate to a lower mantle, high p–t mineral assemblage have geochemical and geotechnical properties suitable for disposal in a nuclear waste repository. our results record the efficient sequestering of radionuclides from contaminated water and this novel, broad-spectrum, nanoscale htc capture and concentration process constitutes a rapid solute decontamination pathway and solids containment option in perpetuity. © 2023, crown.","engineered mineralogical interfaces as radionuclide repositories effective capture of fugitive actinides and daughter radionuclides constitutes a major remediation challenge at legacy or nuclear accident sites globally. the ability of double-layered, anionic clay minerals known as hydrotalcites (htc) to contemporaneously sequester a range of contaminants from solution offers a unique remedy. however, htc do not provide a robust repository for actinide isolation over the long term. in this study, we formed htc by in-situ precipitation in a barren lixiviant from a uranium mine and thermally transformed the resulting radionuclide-laden, nanoscale htc. atomic-scale forensic examination of the amorphized/recrystallised product reveals segregation of u to nanometre-wide mineral interfaces and the local formation of interface-hosted mineral grains. this u-phase is enriched in rare earth elements, a geochemical analogue of actinides such as np and pu, and represents a previously unreported radionuclide interfacial segregation. u-rich phases associated with the mineral interfaces record a u concentration factor of ~ 50,000 relative to the original solute demonstrating high extraction and concentration efficiencies. in addition, the co-existing host mineral suite of periclase, spinel-, and olivine-group minerals that equate to a lower mantle, high p–t mineral assemblage have geochemical and geotechnical properties suitable for disposal in a nuclear waste repository. our results record the efficient sequestering of radionuclides from contaminated water and this novel, broad-spectrum, nanoscale htc capture and concentration process constitutes a rapid solute decontamination pathway and solids containment option in perpetuity. © 2023, crown.",1,water,0.8603823184967041
2023,waste-derived catalysts for water electrolysis: circular economy-driven sustainable green hydrogen energy,"the sustainable production of green hydrogen via water electrolysis necessitates cost-effective electrocatalysts. by following the circular economy principle, the utilization of waste-derived catalysts significantly promotes the sustainable development of green hydrogen energy. currently, diverse waste-derived catalysts have exhibited excellent catalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (her), oxygen evolution reaction (oer), and overall water electrolysis (owe). herein, we systematically examine recent achievements in waste-derived electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. the general principles of water electrolysis and design principles of efficient electrocatalysts are discussed, followed by the illustration of current strategies for transforming wastes into electrocatalysts. then, applications of waste-derived catalysts (i.e., carbon-based catalysts, transitional metal-based catalysts, and carbon-based heterostructure catalysts) in her, oer, and owe are reviewed successively. an emphasis is put on correlating the catalysts’ structure–performance relationship. also, challenges and research directions in this booming field are finally highlighted. this review would provide useful insights into the design, synthesis, and applications of waste-derived electrocatalysts, and thus accelerate the development of the circular economy-driven green hydrogen energy scheme. © 2022, the author(s).","waste-derived catalysts for water electrolysis: circular economy-driven sustainable green hydrogen energy the sustainable production of green hydrogen via water electrolysis necessitates cost-effective electrocatalysts. by following the circular economy principle, the utilization of waste-derived catalysts significantly promotes the sustainable development of green hydrogen energy. currently, diverse waste-derived catalysts have exhibited excellent catalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (her), oxygen evolution reaction (oer), and overall water electrolysis (owe). herein, we systematically examine recent achievements in waste-derived electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. the general principles of water electrolysis and design principles of efficient electrocatalysts are discussed, followed by the illustration of current strategies for transforming wastes into electrocatalysts. then, applications of waste-derived catalysts (i.e., carbon-based catalysts, transitional metal-based catalysts, and carbon-based heterostructure catalysts) in her, oer, and owe are reviewed successively. an emphasis is put on correlating the catalysts’ structure–performance relationship. also, challenges and research directions in this booming field are finally highlighted. this review would provide useful insights into the design, synthesis, and applications of waste-derived electrocatalysts, and thus accelerate the development of the circular economy-driven green hydrogen energy scheme. © 2022, the author(s).",3,metal,0.9528297185897827
2023,greywater treatment in a green wall using different filter materials and hydraulic loading rates,"green walls in urban environments can be both an aesthetic feature and be of practical use in greywater treatment. this study evaluates the effect of different loading rates (4.5 l/d, 9 l/d, and 18 l/d) on the efficiency of treating actual greywater from a city district in a pilot-scale green wall with five different filter materials as substrates (biochar, pumice, hemp fiber, spent coffee grounds (scg), and composted fiber soil (cfs)). three cool climate plant species, carex nigra, juncus compressus, and myosotis scorpioides, were chosen for the green wall. the following parameters were evaluated: biological oxygen demand (bod), fractions of organic carbon, nutrients, indicator bacteria, surfactants, and salt. three of the five materials investigated – biochar, pumice, and cfs - showed promising treatment efficiencies. the respective overall reduction efficiencies of bod, total nitrogen (tn) and total phosphorus (tp) were 99%, 75%, and 57% for biochar; 96%, 58%, and 61% for pumice; and 99%, 82% and 85% for cfs. bod was stable in the biochar filter material with effluent concentrations of 2 mg/l across all investigated loading rates. however, higher loading rates had a significantly negative effect on hemp and pumice for bod. interestingly, the highest loading rate (18 l/d) flowing over pumice removed the highest levels of tn (80%) and tp (86%). biochar was the most effective material in removing indicator bacteria, with a 2.2–4.0 log10 reduction for e. coli and enterococci. scg was the least efficient material, giving a higher bod in the effluent than in the influent. therefore, this study presents the potential of natural and waste-derived filter materials to treat greywater effectively and the results can contribute to the future development of nature-based greywater treatment and management practices in urban areas. © 2023 the authors","greywater treatment in a green wall using different filter materials and hydraulic loading rates green walls in urban environments can be both an aesthetic feature and be of practical use in greywater treatment. this study evaluates the effect of different loading rates (4.5 l/d, 9 l/d, and 18 l/d) on the efficiency of treating actual greywater from a city district in a pilot-scale green wall with five different filter materials as substrates (biochar, pumice, hemp fiber, spent coffee grounds (scg), and composted fiber soil (cfs)). three cool climate plant species, carex nigra, juncus compressus, and myosotis scorpioides, were chosen for the green wall. the following parameters were evaluated: biological oxygen demand (bod), fractions of organic carbon, nutrients, indicator bacteria, surfactants, and salt. three of the five materials investigated – biochar, pumice, and cfs - showed promising treatment efficiencies. the respective overall reduction efficiencies of bod, total nitrogen (tn) and total phosphorus (tp) were 99%, 75%, and 57% for biochar; 96%, 58%, and 61% for pumice; and 99%, 82% and 85% for cfs. bod was stable in the biochar filter material with effluent concentrations of 2 mg/l across all investigated loading rates. however, higher loading rates had a significantly negative effect on hemp and pumice for bod. interestingly, the highest loading rate (18 l/d) flowing over pumice removed the highest levels of tn (80%) and tp (86%). biochar was the most effective material in removing indicator bacteria, with a 2.2–4.0 log10 reduction for e. coli and enterococci. scg was the least efficient material, giving a higher bod in the effluent than in the influent. therefore, this study presents the potential of natural and waste-derived filter materials to treat greywater effectively and the results can contribute to the future development of nature-based greywater treatment and management practices in urban areas. © 2023 the authors",0,soil,0.9677907824516296
2023,surfactant-assisted air flotation: a novel approach for the removal of microplastics from municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash,"the potential for the presence of microplastics (mps) in municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (mswi-ba) has not been fully explored. in this study, surfactant-assisted air flotation separation in aqueous media was used to examine the removal of mps and other pollutants from different particle size fractions of mswi-ba. the use of 1 mmol l−1 sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (sdbs), at a liquid-solid ratio of 60:1, increased by 66 % the quantity of mps floated from the mswi-ba 0–0.3 mm fraction, as compared to pure water. the four most common shapes of the floated mps were pellets, fragments, films and fibers, and the major polymers were polypropylene, polyethylene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polystyrene (approximately 450 μg g−1 ba). the flotation of &lt;10 μm mps increased by up to 7 % using this method compared to flotation in saturated nacl solution. reuse of the flotation solution with the sdbs concentration maintained resulted in reduced mps removal abundance by 22 % in the fourth use as compared to the first use. mps removal correlated positively to sdbs concentration and negatively to turbidity. precipitation from the fourth flotation solution was evaluated using polyacrylamide (pam) and polyaluminium chloride (pac) for the purpose of promoting the regeneration and recycling of the flotation solution. this treatment reduced mps abundance, turbidity, and potential heavy metals in the recycled flotation solution. it is estimated that 3.4 kg of mps could be removed from each ton of mswi-ba. the findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the redistribution of mps during mswi-ba pre-use treatment and provides a reference for the practical application of surfactant-assisted air flotation separation. © 2023 elsevier b.v.","surfactant-assisted air flotation: a novel approach for the removal of microplastics from municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash the potential for the presence of microplastics (mps) in municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (mswi-ba) has not been fully explored. in this study, surfactant-assisted air flotation separation in aqueous media was used to examine the removal of mps and other pollutants from different particle size fractions of mswi-ba. the use of 1 mmol l−1 sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (sdbs), at a liquid-solid ratio of 60:1, increased by 66 % the quantity of mps floated from the mswi-ba 0–0.3 mm fraction, as compared to pure water. the four most common shapes of the floated mps were pellets, fragments, films and fibers, and the major polymers were polypropylene, polyethylene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polystyrene (approximately 450 μg g−1 ba). the flotation of &lt;10 μm mps increased by up to 7 % using this method compared to flotation in saturated nacl solution. reuse of the flotation solution with the sdbs concentration maintained resulted in reduced mps removal abundance by 22 % in the fourth use as compared to the first use. mps removal correlated positively to sdbs concentration and negatively to turbidity. precipitation from the fourth flotation solution was evaluated using polyacrylamide (pam) and polyaluminium chloride (pac) for the purpose of promoting the regeneration and recycling of the flotation solution. this treatment reduced mps abundance, turbidity, and potential heavy metals in the recycled flotation solution. it is estimated that 3.4 kg of mps could be removed from each ton of mswi-ba. the findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the redistribution of mps during mswi-ba pre-use treatment and provides a reference for the practical application of surfactant-assisted air flotation separation. © 2023 elsevier b.v.",2,air,0.8221301436424255

2023,accelerating bioleaching of tungsten mining wastes using indigenous acidophilic bacteria,"the growing amount of w mining waste produced globally is of concern for its proven hazard to the environment and to human health. while uncontrolled biooxidation can result in environmental harm, bioleaching, where pregnant leach solutions are controlled, has been widely used in the mining industry for valuable metals recovery, often from low-grade materials. this bioleaching study was developed to evaluate whether the biogeochemical reprocessing of w tailings could be employed for the decontamination of w-bearing mine waste, combined with valuable metals recovery, i.e., turning a waste into a resource. using an in-vitro laboratory model, the susceptibility of wolframite [(fe,mn)wo4] to acid dissolution during the concomitant oxidation of co-localized sulfidic minerals represented the basic strategy for enhanced w recovery. encouragingly, geochemistry and synchrotron-based x-ray absorption near edge structure of weathered w tailings demonstrated that early-stage wolframite dissolution occurred. however, w dissolution was limited by the formation of secondary w minerals; weathering produced two secondary w minerals i.e., gallium-rich tungstate and minor sanmartinite [(zn,fe)wo4]. the dissolution and re-precipitation of w minerals may provide a strategy for w waste reprocessing if the two processes can be separated by initially putting w into solution, and allowing for its extraction from tailings, followed by its’ recovery by secondary w mineral formation. © 2023 elsevier b.v.","accelerating bioleaching of tungsten mining wastes using indigenous acidophilic bacteria the growing amount of w mining waste produced globally is of concern for its proven hazard to the environment and to human health. while uncontrolled biooxidation can result in environmental harm, bioleaching, where pregnant leach solutions are controlled, has been widely used in the mining industry for valuable metals recovery, often from low-grade materials. this bioleaching study was developed to evaluate whether the biogeochemical reprocessing of w tailings could be employed for the decontamination of w-bearing mine waste, combined with valuable metals recovery, i.e., turning a waste into a resource. using an in-vitro laboratory model, the susceptibility of wolframite [(fe,mn)wo4] to acid dissolution during the concomitant oxidation of co-localized sulfidic minerals represented the basic strategy for enhanced w recovery. encouragingly, geochemistry and synchrotron-based x-ray absorption near edge structure of weathered w tailings demonstrated that early-stage wolframite dissolution occurred. however, w dissolution was limited by the formation of secondary w minerals; weathering produced two secondary w minerals i.e., gallium-rich tungstate and minor sanmartinite [(zn,fe)wo4]. the dissolution and re-precipitation of w minerals may provide a strategy for w waste reprocessing if the two processes can be separated by initially putting w into solution, and allowing for its extraction from tailings, followed by its’ recovery by secondary w mineral formation. © 2023 elsevier b.v.",3,metal,0.9347288608551025

2023,performance of constructed floating wetlands in a cold climate waste stabilization pond,"effectiveness of constructed floating wetlands (cfws) is largely unknown for wastewater treatment in cold climates. an operational-scale cfw system was retrofitted into a municipal waste stabilization pond in alberta, canada. during the first year (study i), insignificant performance was recorded for water quality parameters, although phyto-uptake of elements was evident. in study ii, doubling of the cfw area and addition of underneath aeration promoted plant uptake of elements, including nutrients and metals, following significant pollutant reduction in the water; 83 % of chemical oxygen demand, 80 % of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, 67 % of total suspended solids, and 48 % of total kjeldhal nitrogen. a mesocosm study, conducted in parallel to the pilot scale field study, confirmed the impact of both vegetation and aeration on water quality improvement. the phytoremediation potential was linked to accumulation within plant shoot and root biomass and was confirmed by mass balance. bacterial community analyses reflected that heterotrophic nitrification, aerobic denitrification, complete denitrification, organic matter decomposition, and methylotrophy were dominant mechanisms in the cfw, likely resulting in successful transformation of organics and nutrients. cfws appear to be a viable ecotechnology to treat municipal wastewater in alberta; however, larger and aerated cfw systems are recommended to achieve maximum remediation. the study aligns with the united nations environment program to scale up restoration of degraded ecosystems, and to improve conditions for water supply and biodiversity following recognition of 2021–2030 as the decade on ecosystem restoration. © 2023 elsevier b.v.","performance of constructed floating wetlands in a cold climate waste stabilization pond effectiveness of constructed floating wetlands (cfws) is largely unknown for wastewater treatment in cold climates. an operational-scale cfw system was retrofitted into a municipal waste stabilization pond in alberta, canada. during the first year (study i), insignificant performance was recorded for water quality parameters, although phyto-uptake of elements was evident. in study ii, doubling of the cfw area and addition of underneath aeration promoted plant uptake of elements, including nutrients and metals, following significant pollutant reduction in the water; 83 % of chemical oxygen demand, 80 % of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, 67 % of total suspended solids, and 48 % of total kjeldhal nitrogen. a mesocosm study, conducted in parallel to the pilot scale field study, confirmed the impact of both vegetation and aeration on water quality improvement. the phytoremediation potential was linked to accumulation within plant shoot and root biomass and was confirmed by mass balance. bacterial community analyses reflected that heterotrophic nitrification, aerobic denitrification, complete denitrification, organic matter decomposition, and methylotrophy were dominant mechanisms in the cfw, likely resulting in successful transformation of organics and nutrients. cfws appear to be a viable ecotechnology to treat municipal wastewater in alberta; however, larger and aerated cfw systems are recommended to achieve maximum remediation. the study aligns with the united nations environment program to scale up restoration of degraded ecosystems, and to improve conditions for water supply and biodiversity following recognition of 2021–2030 as the decade on ecosystem restoration. © 2023 elsevier b.v.",1,water,0.8776383996009827
2023,unlocking the potential of sulphide tailings: a comprehensive characterization study for critical mineral recovery,"sulphide tailings are a major environmental concern due to acid mine drainage and heavy metal leaching, with costly treatments that lack economic benefits. reprocessing these wastes for resource recovery can address pollution while creating economic opportunities. this study aimed to evaluate the potential for critical mineral recovery by characterizing sulphide tailings from a zn–cu–pb mining site. advanced analytical tools, such as electron microprobe analysis (empa) and scanning electron microscopy (sem)-based energy dispersive spectroscopy (eds), were utilized to determine the physical, geochemical, and mineralogical properties of the tailings. the results showed that the tailings were fine-grained (∼50 wt% below 63 μm) and composed of si (∼17 wt%), ba (∼13 wt%), and al, fe, and mn (∼6 wt%). of these, mn, a critical mineral, was analyzed for recovery potential, and it was found to be largely contained in rhodochrosite (mnco3) mineral. the metallurgical balance revealed that ∼93 wt% of mn was distributed in −150 + 10 μm size fractions containing 75% of the total mass. additionally, the mineral liberation analysis indicated that mn-grains were primarily liberated below 106 μm size, suggesting the need for light grinding of above 106 μm size to liberate the locked mn minerals. this study demonstrates the potential of sulphide tailings as a source for critical minerals, rather than being a burden, and highlights the benefits of reprocessing them for a resource recovery to address both environmental and economic concerns. © 2023 the author(s)","unlocking the potential of sulphide tailings: a comprehensive characterization study for critical mineral recovery sulphide tailings are a major environmental concern due to acid mine drainage and heavy metal leaching, with costly treatments that lack economic benefits. reprocessing these wastes for resource recovery can address pollution while creating economic opportunities. this study aimed to evaluate the potential for critical mineral recovery by characterizing sulphide tailings from a zn–cu–pb mining site. advanced analytical tools, such as electron microprobe analysis (empa) and scanning electron microscopy (sem)-based energy dispersive spectroscopy (eds), were utilized to determine the physical, geochemical, and mineralogical properties of the tailings. the results showed that the tailings were fine-grained (∼50 wt% below 63 μm) and composed of si (∼17 wt%), ba (∼13 wt%), and al, fe, and mn (∼6 wt%). of these, mn, a critical mineral, was analyzed for recovery potential, and it was found to be largely contained in rhodochrosite (mnco3) mineral. the metallurgical balance revealed that ∼93 wt% of mn was distributed in −150 + 10 μm size fractions containing 75% of the total mass. additionally, the mineral liberation analysis indicated that mn-grains were primarily liberated below 106 μm size, suggesting the need for light grinding of above 106 μm size to liberate the locked mn minerals. this study demonstrates the potential of sulphide tailings as a source for critical minerals, rather than being a burden, and highlights the benefits of reprocessing them for a resource recovery to address both environmental and economic concerns. © 2023 the author(s)",3,metal,0.928960919380188
2023,experimental study on the mechanical performance of tyre encased soil elements for structural wall applications,"tyre-encased-soil elements (teses) are segmental units made by compacting soil inside the cavity of eol tyres. the teses can function similarly to bricks to build masonry walls or other load-bearing structures. tyre walls built of teses have proven successful architectural and structural performance. however, the mechanical properties of teses have not been scientifically investigated in the past, and insufficient evidence restricted teses’ further application as structural components. this project attempted to fill the gap by studying the performance of teses subject to axial compressive loads through both laboratory experiments and analytical analysis. soils with different properties were used in the experiments to quantify their influence on the teses performance. it was found that within the range of loading applied in this study, no abrupt failure was observed on the tested teses. the axial stress-strain relationship followed an exponential form, possibly due to the strain-hardening effect brought in by the densification of encased soil and increased confinement support from the tyre reinforcement. the encased soil's density had a significant influence on the load-deformation behaviour of the teses. however, the load-carrying capacities were not highly sensitive to the soil type and its moisture content. an analytical model was proposed for capturing the axial and radial strain of teses under applied axial loads with a reasonable accuracy. in material characterisation, the strength of eol tyres captured in the inflation tests were significantly larger than those obtained from direct tensile tests, which revealed the cut tyre strip could not capture the synergic effect of the embedded tyre reinforcement composites in a representative manner. the results of this study can be used by built environment professionals to design and analyse the performance of tyre encased soil and tyre walls. © 2023 the authors","experimental study on the mechanical performance of tyre encased soil elements for structural wall applications tyre-encased-soil elements (teses) are segmental units made by compacting soil inside the cavity of eol tyres. the teses can function similarly to bricks to build masonry walls or other load-bearing structures. tyre walls built of teses have proven successful architectural and structural performance. however, the mechanical properties of teses have not been scientifically investigated in the past, and insufficient evidence restricted teses’ further application as structural components. this project attempted to fill the gap by studying the performance of teses subject to axial compressive loads through both laboratory experiments and analytical analysis. soils with different properties were used in the experiments to quantify their influence on the teses performance. it was found that within the range of loading applied in this study, no abrupt failure was observed on the tested teses. the axial stress-strain relationship followed an exponential form, possibly due to the strain-hardening effect brought in by the densification of encased soil and increased confinement support from the tyre reinforcement. the encased soil's density had a significant influence on the load-deformation behaviour of the teses. however, the load-carrying capacities were not highly sensitive to the soil type and its moisture content. an analytical model was proposed for capturing the axial and radial strain of teses under applied axial loads with a reasonable accuracy. in material characterisation, the strength of eol tyres captured in the inflation tests were significantly larger than those obtained from direct tensile tests, which revealed the cut tyre strip could not capture the synergic effect of the embedded tyre reinforcement composites in a representative manner. the results of this study can be used by built environment professionals to design and analyse the performance of tyre encased soil and tyre walls. © 2023 the authors",0,soil,0.9951388835906982

a situation of the source exhaustion of natural materials, and the sufficient utilization of waste local materials becomes a strategy to reduce the carbon emission in infrastructure construction. this promotes a possible economic production of concrete with mixed-sand composited by coarse manufactured-sand and super-fine river-sand. due to lack of study on the mixed-sand used for pumping concrete, an experimental study was carried out in this paper. the proportion of super-fine river-sand and manufactured-sand was determined at a target fineness modulus with a gradation in zone-ii, the sand ratio of concrete was determined by the closed packing test of aggregates. twelve mix proportions of mixed-sand concrete were designed by the absolute volume method, considering the content of super-fine river-sand and the sand ratio. the target cubic compressive strength of mixed-sand concrete was 48.2 mpa, while the target pumpability aimed at pumping height of 300 m. the pumpability of fresh mixed-sand concrete was evaluated by multi-indices including slump, slump flow, static segregation rate, pressure bleeding rate and air content, and explained by the rheological property including the indices of yield stress and plastic viscosity. the mechanical property was evaluated by the cubic and axial compressive strengths, the modulus of elasticity and the splitting tensile strength at curing age from 7 days to 56 days. based on the test results, the absolute volume method for mix proportion design of mixed-sand concrete is rational to keep a consistent unit weight of fresh concrete, the optimal content of super-fine river-sand in mixed-sand is 25%− 35% with a rational sand ratio of 45%− 51%. the developments of compressive strength and tensile strength of mixed-sand concrete are identical to those of conventional concrete. the mixed-sand concrete presents the same relationships to the conventional concrete for the axial compressive strength, the splitting tensile strength and the modulus of elasticity with the cubic compressive strength. however, the splitting tensile strength of mixed-sand concrete is about 90% that of conventional concrete

2023,plastic leachate exposure drives antibiotic resistance and virulence in marine bacterial communities,"plastic pollution is a serious global problem, with more than 12 million tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. plastic debris can have considerable impacts on microbial community structure and functions in marine environments, and has been associated with an enrichment in pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (amr) genes. however, our understanding of these impacts is largely restricted to microbial assemblages on plastic surfaces. it is therefore unclear whether these effects are driven by the surface properties of plastics, providing an additional niche for certain microbes residing in biofilms, and/or chemicals leached from plastics, the effects of which could extend to surrounding planktonic bacteria. here, we examine the effects of polyvinyl chloride (pvc) plastic leachate exposure on the relative abundance of genes associated with bacterial pathogenicity and amr within a seawater microcosm community. we show that pvc leachate, in the absence of plastic surfaces, drives an enrichment in amr and virulence genes. in particular, leachate exposure significantly enriches amr genes that confer multidrug, aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotic resistance. additionally, enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular secretion of virulence proteins was observed among pathogens of marine organisms. this study provides the first evidence that chemicals leached from plastic particles alone can enrich genes related to microbial pathogenesis within a bacterial community, expanding our knowledge of the environmental impacts of plastic pollution with potential consequences for human and ecosystem health. © 2023 the authors","plastic leachate exposure drives antibiotic resistance and virulence in marine bacterial communities plastic pollution is a serious global problem, with more than 12 million tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. plastic debris can have considerable impacts on microbial community structure and functions in marine environments, and has been associated with an enrichment in pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (amr) genes. however, our understanding of these impacts is largely restricted to microbial assemblages on plastic surfaces. it is therefore unclear whether these effects are driven by the surface properties of plastics, providing an additional niche for certain microbes residing in biofilms, and/or chemicals leached from plastics, the effects of which could extend to surrounding planktonic bacteria. here, we examine the effects of polyvinyl chloride (pvc) plastic leachate exposure on the relative abundance of genes associated with bacterial pathogenicity and amr within a seawater microcosm community. we show that pvc leachate, in the absence of plastic surfaces, drives an enrichment in amr and virulence genes. in particular, leachate exposure significantly enriches amr genes that confer multidrug, aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotic resistance. additionally, enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular secretion of virulence proteins was observed among pathogens of marine organisms. this study provides the first evidence that chemicals leached from plastic particles alone can enrich genes related to microbial pathogenesis within a bacterial community, expanding our knowledge of the environmental impacts of plastic pollution with potential consequences for human and ecosystem health. © 2023 the authors",4,chemical,0.8682012557983398

2023,coupling microbial and abiotic amendments accelerates in situ remediation of bauxite residue at field scale,"bauxite residue is a highly saline-sodic tailings material formed as a by-product of the bayer process for alumina production. in situ remediation of bauxite residue has the potential to provide an effective means for accelerated rehabilitation of residue storage areas. however, previous work has predominantly only used chemical and physical amendments to date, limiting rates of ph neutralisation and extent of remediation. combining these abiotic amendments with recently developed microbial biotechnology for ph neutralisation may transform bauxite residue into a productive soil material in a shorter timeframe. here we investigated the effects of microbial and abiotic amendments (compost plus tillage), both in isolation and combined, on remediation of key bauxite residue properties in field scale trials (10 × 15 m × 2 m deep field plots). triplicate residue samples were collected to 30 cm depth from each plot in quarterly field sampling campaigns. changes in chemical and physical properties were monitored to assess remediation performance under different amendments. after one year, field plots amended with a microbial treatment had significantly (p < 0.05) lower average ph (8.99–9.46) in the upper 20 cm than the control (10.3). the combined microbial-abiotic treatment also had improved physical structure, higher organic c and lower electrical conductivity than the microbial treatment alone. the strong performance of the microbial-abiotic treatment is attributed to the combined benefits of bioneutralisation from microbial fermentation products, enhanced leaching of alkaline pore water and salts due to tillage and compost, and addition of highly stable c and n in compost. combining novel microbial biotechnology with common abiotic amendments is therefore suggested for accelerating in situ remediation progress towards a material amenable for plant growth. © 2023","coupling microbial and abiotic amendments accelerates in situ remediation of bauxite residue at field scale bauxite residue is a highly saline-sodic tailings material formed as a by-product of the bayer process for alumina production. in situ remediation of bauxite residue has the potential to provide an effective means for accelerated rehabilitation of residue storage areas. however, previous work has predominantly only used chemical and physical amendments to date, limiting rates of ph neutralisation and extent of remediation. combining these abiotic amendments with recently developed microbial biotechnology for ph neutralisation may transform bauxite residue into a productive soil material in a shorter timeframe. here we investigated the effects of microbial and abiotic amendments (compost plus tillage), both in isolation and combined, on remediation of key bauxite residue properties in field scale trials (10 × 15 m × 2 m deep field plots). triplicate residue samples were collected to 30 cm depth from each plot in quarterly field sampling campaigns. changes in chemical and physical properties were monitored to assess remediation performance under different amendments. after one year, field plots amended with a microbial treatment had significantly (p < 0.05) lower average ph (8.99–9.46) in the upper 20 cm than the control (10.3). the combined microbial-abiotic treatment also had improved physical structure, higher organic c and lower electrical conductivity than the microbial treatment alone. the strong performance of the microbial-abiotic treatment is attributed to the combined benefits of bioneutralisation from microbial fermentation products, enhanced leaching of alkaline pore water and salts due to tillage and compost, and addition of highly stable c and n in compost. combining novel microbial biotechnology with common abiotic amendments is therefore suggested for accelerating in situ remediation progress towards a material amenable for plant growth. © 2023",0,soil,0.9568490982055664

2023,calibration of a microporous polyethylene tube passive sampler for polar organic compounds in wastewater effluent,"water resources are vulnerable to contamination from polar organic compounds (pocs) originating from sources such as wastewater effluent. two configurations of a microporous polyethylene tube (mpt) passive sampler were investigated for the time-integrative detection and quantification of pocs in effluent. one configuration contained the polymeric reversed phase sorbent strata-x (sx) and the other strata-x suspended in agarose gel (sx-gel). these were deployed for up to 29 days and analysed for forty-nine pocs including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (ppcps) together with illicit drugs. complementary composite samples were collected on days 6, 12, 20 and 26 representing the previous 24 h. thirty-eight contaminants were detected in composite samples and mpt extracts, with mpt sampling rates (rs) for 11 pesticides and 9 ppcps/drugs ranging from 0.81 to 10.32 ml d−1 in sx and 1.35–32.83 ml d−1 in sx-gel. half-times to equilibrium of contaminants with the sx and sx-gel equipped samplers ranged from two days to &gt;29 days. mpt (sx) samplers were also deployed at 10 wastewater treatment effluent discharge sites across australia for 7 days (again with complementary composite samples), to validate the sampler performance under varying conditions. extracts from these mpts detected 48 contaminants in comparison with 46 in composite samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 138 ng ml−1. an advantage of the mpt was preconcentration of contaminants, resulting in extract levels often markedly above instrument analytical detection limits. the validation study demonstrated a high correlation between accumulated contaminant mass in the mpts and wastewater concentrations from composite samples (r2 &gt; 0.70, where concentrations in composite samples were &gt; 3× lod). the mpt sampler shows promise as a sensitive tool for detecting pocs at trace levels in wastewater effluent and also quantifying these levels if temporal concentration variations are not significant. © 2023","calibration of a microporous polyethylene tube passive sampler for polar organic compounds in wastewater effluent water resources are vulnerable to contamination from polar organic compounds (pocs) originating from sources such as wastewater effluent. two configurations of a microporous polyethylene tube (mpt) passive sampler were investigated for the time-integrative detection and quantification of pocs in effluent. one configuration contained the polymeric reversed phase sorbent strata-x (sx) and the other strata-x suspended in agarose gel (sx-gel). these were deployed for up to 29 days and analysed for forty-nine pocs including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (ppcps) together with illicit drugs. complementary composite samples were collected on days 6, 12, 20 and 26 representing the previous 24 h. thirty-eight contaminants were detected in composite samples and mpt extracts, with mpt sampling rates (rs) for 11 pesticides and 9 ppcps/drugs ranging from 0.81 to 10.32 ml d−1 in sx and 1.35–32.83 ml d−1 in sx-gel. half-times to equilibrium of contaminants with the sx and sx-gel equipped samplers ranged from two days to &gt;29 days. mpt (sx) samplers were also deployed at 10 wastewater treatment effluent discharge sites across australia for 7 days (again with complementary composite samples), to validate the sampler performance under varying conditions. extracts from these mpts detected 48 contaminants in comparison with 46 in composite samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 138 ng ml−1. an advantage of the mpt was preconcentration of contaminants, resulting in extract levels often markedly above instrument analytical detection limits. the validation study demonstrated a high correlation between accumulated contaminant mass in the mpts and wastewater concentrations from composite samples (r2 &gt; 0.70, where concentrations in composite samples were &gt; 3× lod). the mpt sampler shows promise as a sensitive tool for detecting pocs at trace levels in wastewater effluent and also quantifying these levels if temporal concentration variations are not significant. © 2023",1,water,0.8294851183891296

2023,microalgae enrichment for biomass harvesting and water reuse by ceramic microfiltration membranes,"harvesting and water reuse are two critical issues for large-scale microalgae cultivation. using two representative microalgae species, namely c. vulgaris and scenedesmus sp., this study evaluates the performance of a ceramic microfiltration membrane to extract clean water for reuse and pre-concentrate the microalgae solution for subsequent harvesting. the results show that fouling was specific to each individual microalgae species due to the difference in cell properties (e.g. size, shape, and cell membrane). importantly, membrane fouling could be efficiently mitigated by aeration and regular backwashing without any chemical addition. aeration reduced the transmembrane pressure when filtering c. vulgaris and scenedesmus sp. by 56 and 38%, respectively. in long-term performance experiments, c. vulgaris showed considerable membrane fouling over time; by contrast, scenedesmus sp. showed negligible fouling. the results reaffirmed that membrane filtration efficiency was microalgae species-specific. permeate water reuse for growing another batch of microalgae was also demonstrated using both species. results reported here suggest that ceramic microfiltration membrane can simultaneously enrich the microalgae solution and recycle permeated water for microalgae cultivation. © 2022","microalgae enrichment for biomass harvesting and water reuse by ceramic microfiltration membranes harvesting and water reuse are two critical issues for large-scale microalgae cultivation. using two representative microalgae species, namely c. vulgaris and scenedesmus sp., this study evaluates the performance of a ceramic microfiltration membrane to extract clean water for reuse and pre-concentrate the microalgae solution for subsequent harvesting. the results show that fouling was specific to each individual microalgae species due to the difference in cell properties (e.g. size, shape, and cell membrane). importantly, membrane fouling could be efficiently mitigated by aeration and regular backwashing without any chemical addition. aeration reduced the transmembrane pressure when filtering c. vulgaris and scenedesmus sp. by 56 and 38%, respectively. in long-term performance experiments, c. vulgaris showed considerable membrane fouling over time; by contrast, scenedesmus sp. showed negligible fouling. the results reaffirmed that membrane filtration efficiency was microalgae species-specific. permeate water reuse for growing another batch of microalgae was also demonstrated using both species. results reported here suggest that ceramic microfiltration membrane can simultaneously enrich the microalgae solution and recycle permeated water for microalgae cultivation. © 2022",1,water,0.829295814037323

2023,effect of different co-foaming agents on pfas removal from the environment by foam fractionation,"per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (pfas) are recalcitrant, synthetic chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment because of their widespread use in a variety of consumer and industrial products. pfas contamination has become an increasing issue in recent years, which needs to be urgently addressed. foam fractionation is emerging as a potential remediation option that removes pfas by adsorption to the surface of rising air bubbles which are removed from the system as a foam. pfas concentrations in the environment are often not sufficient to allow for formation of a foam by itself and often a co-foaming agent is required to be added to enhance the foamability of the solution. in this study, the effect of different classes of co-foaming agents, anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic and cationic surfactants on the removal of pfas with varying fluorocarbon chain length from 3 to 8 in a foam fractionation process have been investigated. evaluation of the air-water interface partitioning coefficient (k’) in addition with surface tension and pfas removal results support the contention that using a co-foaming agent with the opposite charge to the pfas in question significantly facilitates the adsorption of pfas to the air-water interface, enhancing the efficiency of the process. using the non-ionic surfactant (no headgroup electrostatic interaction with pfas), as a reference, it was observed, in terms of pfas separation and rate of pfas removal, that anionic co-surfactant performed worst, zwitterionic was better, and cationic co-surfactant performed best. all of the pfas species were able to be removed below the limit of detection (0.05 µg/l) after 45 minutes of foaming time with the cationic surfactant. © 2022","effect of different co-foaming agents on pfas removal from the environment by foam fractionation per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (pfas) are recalcitrant, synthetic chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment because of their widespread use in a variety of consumer and industrial products. pfas contamination has become an increasing issue in recent years, which needs to be urgently addressed. foam fractionation is emerging as a potential remediation option that removes pfas by adsorption to the surface of rising air bubbles which are removed from the system as a foam. pfas concentrations in the environment are often not sufficient to allow for formation of a foam by itself and often a co-foaming agent is required to be added to enhance the foamability of the solution. in this study, the effect of different classes of co-foaming agents, anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic and cationic surfactants on the removal of pfas with varying fluorocarbon chain length from 3 to 8 in a foam fractionation process have been investigated. evaluation of the air-water interface partitioning coefficient (k’) in addition with surface tension and pfas removal results support the contention that using a co-foaming agent with the opposite charge to the pfas in question significantly facilitates the adsorption of pfas to the air-water interface, enhancing the efficiency of the process. using the non-ionic surfactant (no headgroup electrostatic interaction with pfas), as a reference, it was observed, in terms of pfas separation and rate of pfas removal, that anionic co-surfactant performed worst, zwitterionic was better, and cationic co-surfactant performed best. all of the pfas species were able to be removed below the limit of detection (0.05 µg/l) after 45 minutes of foaming time with the cationic surfactant. © 2022",2,air,0.9812002778053284

2023,1the harm of residual plastic film and its accumulation driving factors in northwest china,"the background to this research is stark and rather troubling: the ongoing accumulation of residual plastic film (rpf) in farmland ultimately threatens the sustainable development of agriculture and food security. in this study, we selected 15 counties in northern china to analyze the effect of rpf content on soil properties and crop yield and the driving factors through sampling and survey questionnaire. the linear mixed-effects model revealed the four main factors affecting rpf content, ranked as follows: plastic film mulching years &gt; government recycling policy &gt; spacing between rows &gt; recycling methods (0.47493 &gt; 0.25635 &gt; 0.23380 &gt; 0.17001). the contribution value of plastic film thickness was very low (r2(m) = 0.099). the plastic film width and spacing within rows did not significantly affect rpf content. the structural equation model showed that the rpf had both direct (−0.111) and indirect (−0.010) effects on maize yield. a 1 kg ha−1 increase in rpf content decreased maize yield by 27.67 kg ha−1. rpf did not directly affect soil organic carbon (soc), ph, or ammonium nitrogen. rpf mainly aggravated soil salinization by increasing soil nitrate-nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium, increasing soc and decreasing ph, thus reducing crop yield. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine the driving factors of rpf accumulation and the effects of rpf on soil properties and crop yield in a large-scale sampling and survey questionnaire. rpf accumulation in the study area has aggravated soil salinization and reduced crop yields. hence, measures are needed to alleviate the current situation. local governments should formulate rpf recovery policies based on their actual situation. at the national level, more research is needed to develop rpf recovery machinery to improve efficiency. © 2022 elsevier ltd","1the harm of residual plastic film and its accumulation driving factors in northwest china the background to this research is stark and rather troubling: the ongoing accumulation of residual plastic film (rpf) in farmland ultimately threatens the sustainable development of agriculture and food security. in this study, we selected 15 counties in northern china to analyze the effect of rpf content on soil properties and crop yield and the driving factors through sampling and survey questionnaire. the linear mixed-effects model revealed the four main factors affecting rpf content, ranked as follows: plastic film mulching years &gt; government recycling policy &gt; spacing between rows &gt; recycling methods (0.47493 &gt; 0.25635 &gt; 0.23380 &gt; 0.17001). the contribution value of plastic film thickness was very low (r2(m) = 0.099). the plastic film width and spacing within rows did not significantly affect rpf content. the structural equation model showed that the rpf had both direct (−0.111) and indirect (−0.010) effects on maize yield. a 1 kg ha−1 increase in rpf content decreased maize yield by 27.67 kg ha−1. rpf did not directly affect soil organic carbon (soc), ph, or ammonium nitrogen. rpf mainly aggravated soil salinization by increasing soil nitrate-nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium, increasing soc and decreasing ph, thus reducing crop yield. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine the driving factors of rpf accumulation and the effects of rpf on soil properties and crop yield in a large-scale sampling and survey questionnaire. rpf accumulation in the study area has aggravated soil salinization and reduced crop yields. hence, measures are needed to alleviate the current situation. local governments should formulate rpf recovery policies based on their actual situation. at the national level, more research is needed to develop rpf recovery machinery to improve efficiency. © 2022 elsevier ltd",0,soil,0.9906656742095947
2023,removing methylene blue from water: a study of sorption effectiveness onto nanoparticles-doped activated carbon,"in this present study, silver (ag) and titanium dioxide (tio2) nanoparticles were successfully deposited on coconut shell-derived activated carbon (csac), to synthesize a novel nanocomposite (csac@agnps@tio2nps) for the adsorption of methylene blue (mb) dye from aqueous solution. the fabricated csac@agnps@tio2nps nanocomposite was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (sem), x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), transmission electron microscope (tem) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (eds) detector, x-ray photoelectron spectroscope (xps), and brunauer–emmett–teller (bet). the successful deposition of agnps and tio2nps on csac surface was revealed by the tem/edx, sem, and xps analysis. the mesopore structure of csac@agnps@tio2nps has a bet surface area of 301 m2/g. the batch adsorption studies were conducted and the influence of different parameters, i.e., adsorbent dose, adsorption time, initial dye concentration, ph and temperature were investigated. the nonlinear isotherm and kinetic modelling demonstrated that adsorption data were best fitted by sips isotherm and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. the maximum adsorption capacity of mb onto csac@agnps@tio2nps by the sips model was 184 mg/g. thermodynamic results revealed that the adsorption was endothermic, spontaneous and physical in nature. csac@agnps@tio2nps revealed that mb absorption by csac@agnps@tio2nps was spontaneous and endothermic. the uptake capacity of mb was influenced significantly by the presence of competing ions including, no3−, hco3, ca2+, and na+. repeated tests indicated that the csac@agnps@tio2nps can be regenerated and reused six times before being discarded. the primary separation mechanism between mb dye and csac@agnps@tio2nps was the electrostatic interaction. thus, csac@agnps@tio2nps was an outstanding material, which displayed good applicability in real water with ≥ 97% removal of mb dye. © 2022 elsevier ltd","removing methylene blue from water: a study of sorption effectiveness onto nanoparticles-doped activated carbon in this present study, silver (ag) and titanium dioxide (tio2) nanoparticles were successfully deposited on coconut shell-derived activated carbon (csac), to synthesize a novel nanocomposite (csac@agnps@tio2nps) for the adsorption of methylene blue (mb) dye from aqueous solution. the fabricated csac@agnps@tio2nps nanocomposite was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (sem), x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), transmission electron microscope (tem) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (eds) detector, x-ray photoelectron spectroscope (xps), and brunauer–emmett–teller (bet). the successful deposition of agnps and tio2nps on csac surface was revealed by the tem/edx, sem, and xps analysis. the mesopore structure of csac@agnps@tio2nps has a bet surface area of 301 m2/g. the batch adsorption studies were conducted and the influence of different parameters, i.e., adsorbent dose, adsorption time, initial dye concentration, ph and temperature were investigated. the nonlinear isotherm and kinetic modelling demonstrated that adsorption data were best fitted by sips isotherm and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. the maximum adsorption capacity of mb onto csac@agnps@tio2nps by the sips model was 184 mg/g. thermodynamic results revealed that the adsorption was endothermic, spontaneous and physical in nature. csac@agnps@tio2nps revealed that mb absorption by csac@agnps@tio2nps was spontaneous and endothermic. the uptake capacity of mb was influenced significantly by the presence of competing ions including, no3−, hco3, ca2+, and na+. repeated tests indicated that the csac@agnps@tio2nps can be regenerated and reused six times before being discarded. the primary separation mechanism between mb dye and csac@agnps@tio2nps was the electrostatic interaction. thus, csac@agnps@tio2nps was an outstanding material, which displayed good applicability in real water with ≥ 97% removal of mb dye. © 2022 elsevier ltd",1,water,0.9686762094497681
2023,a review of particulate pollution over himalaya region: characteristics and salient factors contributing ambient pm pollution,"the himalayas, which include delicate and unspoiled ecosystems, have the third-largest glacier ice store in the world. recent research reveals that anthropogenic and natural factors contribute to the deteriorating air quality in the region. rising particulate matter (pm) levels might have devastating effects on the regional climate, hydrologic cycles, and ecology. given the scarcity of studies (the majority of which are of short duration and focus on a single pollutant and satellite-based observation), unique topography, meteorological characteristics, monsoon dynamics, temperature inversion, and mixing of pollution emission from local and distant sources, it is difficult to understand the general pollution trend in the himalaya. nonetheless, past studies indicate that local biomass burning, long-distance transport, especially from the indo-gangetic plain (igps), dust storms, and tourist activities are the primary drivers to rising pm pollution in the himalayas region. emissions from these sources develop exponentially and encompass severe pollution episodes because of the igp's complicated hilly terrain, cloud condensation nucleation process, atmospheric brown clouds (haze), dust storm, and transport of pm from crop residue burning (especially during the post-monsoon season). in light of this, the current work outlines the sources, factors, and variables that contribute to the himalayan region's rising pollution levels and sheds light on significant areas of recent research. the present study examines in depth the consequences of the monsoon, the dynamics of pollution in igp, and the movement of pm from igp to the himalayan region. this review aims to highlight research gaps and limitations in the existing literature for a better understanding of the current pm pollution in the himalayas and surrounding sites, which is essential for understanding climate change and health consequences in this region, and to provide significant theoretical and practical implications for assessing particulate pollution in the himalayas region. © 2022 elsevier ltd","a review of particulate pollution over himalaya region: characteristics and salient factors contributing ambient pm pollution the himalayas, which include delicate and unspoiled ecosystems, have the third-largest glacier ice store in the world. recent research reveals that anthropogenic and natural factors contribute to the deteriorating air quality in the region. rising particulate matter (pm) levels might have devastating effects on the regional climate, hydrologic cycles, and ecology. given the scarcity of studies (the majority of which are of short duration and focus on a single pollutant and satellite-based observation), unique topography, meteorological characteristics, monsoon dynamics, temperature inversion, and mixing of pollution emission from local and distant sources, it is difficult to understand the general pollution trend in the himalaya. nonetheless, past studies indicate that local biomass burning, long-distance transport, especially from the indo-gangetic plain (igps), dust storms, and tourist activities are the primary drivers to rising pm pollution in the himalayas region. emissions from these sources develop exponentially and encompass severe pollution episodes because of the igp's complicated hilly terrain, cloud condensation nucleation process, atmospheric brown clouds (haze), dust storm, and transport of pm from crop residue burning (especially during the post-monsoon season). in light of this, the current work outlines the sources, factors, and variables that contribute to the himalayan region's rising pollution levels and sheds light on significant areas of recent research. the present study examines in depth the consequences of the monsoon, the dynamics of pollution in igp, and the movement of pm from igp to the himalayan region. this review aims to highlight research gaps and limitations in the existing literature for a better understanding of the current pm pollution in the himalayas and surrounding sites, which is essential for understanding climate change and health consequences in this region, and to provide significant theoretical and practical implications for assessing particulate pollution in the himalayas region. © 2022 elsevier ltd",2,air,0.9726004600524902

2023,the long-term uncertainty of biodegradable mulch film residues and associated microplastics pollution on plant-soil health,"biodegradable mulch film potentially offers an encouraging alternative to conventional (petroleum-based) plastic films. since biodegradable films are more susceptible to rapid degradation, more microplastics (mps) are likely to be generated than conventional films within the same time frame, probably leading to more severe mps pollution and associated effects. however, the effect of biodegradable mulch film residues and associated mps pollution on plant-soil health remains uncertainty. here, we evaluated the potential effect of bio-mps pollution on soil carbon (c) and nutrient (i.e., n and p) cycling, soil biology (microorganisms and mesofauna), and plant health, as these are crucial to agroecosystem functioning and the delivery of key ecosystem services. unlike the inert (and therefore recalcitrant) c contained within petroleum-based mps, at least 80% of the c from bio-mps is converted to co2, with up to 20% immobilized in living microbial biomass (i.e., &lt; 0.05 t c ha−1). although biodegradable films are unlikely to be important in promoting soil c storage, they may accelerate microbial biomass turnover in the short term, as well as co2 production. compared to conventional mps, bio-mps degradation is more pronounced, thereby inducing greater alterations in microbial diversity and community composition. this may further alter n2o and ch4 emissions, and ultimately resulting in unpredictable consequences for global climate warming. the extent to which this may occur, however, has yet to be shown in either laboratory or field studies. in addition, bio-mps have a large chance of forming nanoplastics, potentially causing a stronger toxic effect on plants relative to conventional mps. consequently, this would influence plant health, crop productivity, and food safety, leading to potential health risks. it is unclear, however, if these are direct effects on key plant processes (e.g. signaling, cell expansion) or indirect effects (e.g. nutrient deficiency or acidification). overall, the question as to whether biodegradable mulch films offer a promising alternative to solve the conventional plastic legacy in soil over the long term remains unclear. © 2022","the long-term uncertainty of biodegradable mulch film residues and associated microplastics pollution on plant-soil health biodegradable mulch film potentially offers an encouraging alternative to conventional (petroleum-based) plastic films. since biodegradable films are more susceptible to rapid degradation, more microplastics (mps) are likely to be generated than conventional films within the same time frame, probably leading to more severe mps pollution and associated effects. however, the effect of biodegradable mulch film residues and associated mps pollution on plant-soil health remains uncertainty. here, we evaluated the potential effect of bio-mps pollution on soil carbon (c) and nutrient (i.e., n and p) cycling, soil biology (microorganisms and mesofauna), and plant health, as these are crucial to agroecosystem functioning and the delivery of key ecosystem services. unlike the inert (and therefore recalcitrant) c contained within petroleum-based mps, at least 80% of the c from bio-mps is converted to co2, with up to 20% immobilized in living microbial biomass (i.e., &lt; 0.05 t c ha−1). although biodegradable films are unlikely to be important in promoting soil c storage, they may accelerate microbial biomass turnover in the short term, as well as co2 production. compared to conventional mps, bio-mps degradation is more pronounced, thereby inducing greater alterations in microbial diversity and community composition. this may further alter n2o and ch4 emissions, and ultimately resulting in unpredictable consequences for global climate warming. the extent to which this may occur, however, has yet to be shown in either laboratory or field studies. in addition, bio-mps have a large chance of forming nanoplastics, potentially causing a stronger toxic effect on plants relative to conventional mps. consequently, this would influence plant health, crop productivity, and food safety, leading to potential health risks. it is unclear, however, if these are direct effects on key plant processes (e.g. signaling, cell expansion) or indirect effects (e.g. nutrient deficiency or acidification). overall, the question as to whether biodegradable mulch films offer a promising alternative to solve the conventional plastic legacy in soil over the long term remains unclear. © 2022",0,soil,0.9841743111610413

2022,microfibers in laundry wastewater: problem and solution,"data corroborated in this study highlights laundry wastewater as a primary source of microfibers (mfs) in the aquatic environment. mfs can negatively impact the aquatic ecosystem via five possible pathways, namely, acting as carriers of other contaminats, physical damage to digestive systems of aquatic organisms, blocking the digestive tract, releasing toxic chemicals, and harbouring invasive and noxious plankton and bacteria. this review shows that small devices to capture mfs during household laundry activities are simple to use and affordable at household level in developed countries. however, these low cost and small devices are unrealiable and can only achieve up to 40 % mf removal efficiency. in line filtration devices can achieve higher removal efficiency under well maintained condition but their performance is still limited compared to over 98 % mf removal by large scale centralized wastewater treatment. these results infer that effort to increase sanitation coverage to ensure adequate wastewater treatment prior to environmental discharge is likely to be more cost effective than those small devices for capturing mfs. this review also shows that natural fabrics would entail significantly less environmental consequences than synthetic materials. contribution from the fashion industry to increase the share of natural frabics in the current textile market can also reduce the loading of plastic mfs in the environment. © 2022","microfibers in laundry wastewater: problem and solution data corroborated in this study highlights laundry wastewater as a primary source of microfibers (mfs) in the aquatic environment. mfs can negatively impact the aquatic ecosystem via five possible pathways, namely, acting as carriers of other contaminats, physical damage to digestive systems of aquatic organisms, blocking the digestive tract, releasing toxic chemicals, and harbouring invasive and noxious plankton and bacteria. this review shows that small devices to capture mfs during household laundry activities are simple to use and affordable at household level in developed countries. however, these low cost and small devices are unrealiable and can only achieve up to 40 % mf removal efficiency. in line filtration devices can achieve higher removal efficiency under well maintained condition but their performance is still limited compared to over 98 % mf removal by large scale centralized wastewater treatment. these results infer that effort to increase sanitation coverage to ensure adequate wastewater treatment prior to environmental discharge is likely to be more cost effective than those small devices for capturing mfs. this review also shows that natural fabrics would entail significantly less environmental consequences than synthetic materials. contribution from the fashion industry to increase the share of natural frabics in the current textile market can also reduce the loading of plastic mfs in the environment. © 2022",1,water,0.9501540660858154

2022,carbon encapsulated iron oxide for simultaneous fenton degradation and adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes from water,"adsorption and fenton oxidation processes are considered the most effective ways to treat industrial dye effluent. however, the separation of adsorbent materials and the leaching of secondary pollutants are big hurdles. to resolve these issues, here, we have developed a unique hybrid structure (fe3o4 @c) by encapsulating iron oxide into carbon shells using olive mill waste in a one-step process. the resulting unique core-shell fe3o4 @c structure possessed both tunned surface functional groups (carboxylic, carbonyl, and amines) and magnetic properties, which can be easily separated from treated water using a magnet. upon using fe3o4 @c as a catalyst, it simultaneously removed/ degraded both congo red (cr) and methylene blue (mb) up to 94% through fenton oxidation. icp-ms analysis detected negligible (6.6 ppb) iron leaching even in fenton degradation, which is far lower than the allowable leaching limit of 300 ppb showing the efficacy of the developed structure. this is due to the core-shell structure where fe3o4 remains active inside the core due to dual protection by encapsulating inside a semicrystalline carbon shell, which is then protected by a porous carbon matrix. this double protection assists high adsorption and maintains efficient charge transfer that favors high catalytic activity with limited iron leaching. further to prove this fe3o4 @c was used in 5 consecutive adsorption cycles, where it removed 94.4% mb after 5th cycle and even preserved the pristine core-shell structure and chemical bonds as indicated by ex-situ energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark field, high-angle annular bright field, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. hence, this study successfully showed that olive waste could be converted into a functional material that can further be used at a large scale for pollutant removal from wastewater. © 2022 elsevier ltd.","carbon encapsulated iron oxide for simultaneous fenton degradation and adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes from water adsorption and fenton oxidation processes are considered the most effective ways to treat industrial dye effluent. however, the separation of adsorbent materials and the leaching of secondary pollutants are big hurdles. to resolve these issues, here, we have developed a unique hybrid structure (fe3o4 @c) by encapsulating iron oxide into carbon shells using olive mill waste in a one-step process. the resulting unique core-shell fe3o4 @c structure possessed both tunned surface functional groups (carboxylic, carbonyl, and amines) and magnetic properties, which can be easily separated from treated water using a magnet. upon using fe3o4 @c as a catalyst, it simultaneously removed/ degraded both congo red (cr) and methylene blue (mb) up to 94% through fenton oxidation. icp-ms analysis detected negligible (6.6 ppb) iron leaching even in fenton degradation, which is far lower than the allowable leaching limit of 300 ppb showing the efficacy of the developed structure. this is due to the core-shell structure where fe3o4 remains active inside the core due to dual protection by encapsulating inside a semicrystalline carbon shell, which is then protected by a porous carbon matrix. this double protection assists high adsorption and maintains efficient charge transfer that favors high catalytic activity with limited iron leaching. further to prove this fe3o4 @c was used in 5 consecutive adsorption cycles, where it removed 94.4% mb after 5th cycle and even preserved the pristine core-shell structure and chemical bonds as indicated by ex-situ energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark field, high-angle annular bright field, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. hence, this study successfully showed that olive waste could be converted into a functional material that can further be used at a large scale for pollutant removal from wastewater. © 2022 elsevier ltd.",1,water,0.8717586994171143

2022,laboratory and in situ stabilization of compacted clay through granite waste powder,"the main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of granite waste powder on the behavior of compacted clay soil in both field and laboratory environments. samples were collected from clay soil exposed at karak, khyber pakhtunkhwa, pakistan. the sampled soils contain kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonites. the samples were mixed with various quantities, i.e., 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% by weight of granite waste powder collected from various stone industries in district mansehra, khyber pakhtunkhwa, pakistan. they were then subjected to a variety of geotechnical testing in both the laboratory and the field, following the standard astm procedures. the results show that mixing with granite-cutting waste enhances the quality of the soil in both the field and laboratory settings by increasing its bearing capacity (bc), dry density (dd), california-bearing ratio (cbr), unconfined compressive strength (ucs), penetration resistance, and angle of internal friction and by reducing the optimum moisture content, cohesion, porosity, void ratio, and saturation potential. the resulting improvement is mainly due to the stronger, denser, and less hydrophilic character of the constituents of the added rock powders than the raw soil. it is observed that adding 40% granite waste powder produces the best outcome. however, there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the impact on soil quality between the laboratory and field testing. owing to differences in the testing environment, soil volume, and compaction effort and energy, the amount of improvement is higher in laboratory testing than in field testing. © 2022 by the authors.","laboratory and in situ stabilization of compacted clay through granite waste powder the main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of granite waste powder on the behavior of compacted clay soil in both field and laboratory environments. samples were collected from clay soil exposed at karak, khyber pakhtunkhwa, pakistan. the sampled soils contain kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonites. the samples were mixed with various quantities, i.e., 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% by weight of granite waste powder collected from various stone industries in district mansehra, khyber pakhtunkhwa, pakistan. they were then subjected to a variety of geotechnical testing in both the laboratory and the field, following the standard astm procedures. the results show that mixing with granite-cutting waste enhances the quality of the soil in both the field and laboratory settings by increasing its bearing capacity (bc), dry density (dd), california-bearing ratio (cbr), unconfined compressive strength (ucs), penetration resistance, and angle of internal friction and by reducing the optimum moisture content, cohesion, porosity, void ratio, and saturation potential. the resulting improvement is mainly due to the stronger, denser, and less hydrophilic character of the constituents of the added rock powders than the raw soil. it is observed that adding 40% granite waste powder produces the best outcome. however, there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the impact on soil quality between the laboratory and field testing. owing to differences in the testing environment, soil volume, and compaction effort and energy, the amount of improvement is higher in laboratory testing than in field testing. © 2022 by the authors.",0,soil,0.9588730931282043

2022,city-wide wastewater genomic surveillance through the successive emergence of sars-cov-2 alpha and delta variants,"genomic surveillance of sars-cov-2 has provided a critical evidence base for public health decisions throughout the pandemic. sequencing data from clinical cases has helped to understand disease transmission and the spread of novel variants. genomic wastewater surveillance can offer important, complementary information by providing frequency estimates of all variants circulating in a population without sampling biases. here we show that genomic sars-cov-2 wastewater surveillance can detect fine-scale differences within urban centres, specifically within the city of liverpool, uk, during the emergence of alpha and delta variants between november 2020 and june 2021. furthermore, wastewater and clinical sequencing match well in the estimated timing of new variant rises and the first detection of a new variant in a given area may occur in either clinical or wastewater samples. the study's main limitation was sample quality when infection prevalence was low in spring 2021, resulting in a lower resolution of the rise of the delta variant compared to the rise of the alpha variant in the previous winter. the correspondence between wastewater and clinical variant frequencies demonstrates the reliability of wastewater surveillance. however, discrepancies in the first detection of the alpha variant between the two approaches highlight that wastewater monitoring can also capture missing information, possibly resulting from asymptomatic cases or communities less engaged with testing programmes, as found by a simultaneous surge testing effort across the city. © 2022 the authors","city-wide wastewater genomic surveillance through the successive emergence of sars-cov-2 alpha and delta variants genomic surveillance of sars-cov-2 has provided a critical evidence base for public health decisions throughout the pandemic. sequencing data from clinical cases has helped to understand disease transmission and the spread of novel variants. genomic wastewater surveillance can offer important, complementary information by providing frequency estimates of all variants circulating in a population without sampling biases. here we show that genomic sars-cov-2 wastewater surveillance can detect fine-scale differences within urban centres, specifically within the city of liverpool, uk, during the emergence of alpha and delta variants between november 2020 and june 2021. furthermore, wastewater and clinical sequencing match well in the estimated timing of new variant rises and the first detection of a new variant in a given area may occur in either clinical or wastewater samples. the study's main limitation was sample quality when infection prevalence was low in spring 2021, resulting in a lower resolution of the rise of the delta variant compared to the rise of the alpha variant in the previous winter. the correspondence between wastewater and clinical variant frequencies demonstrates the reliability of wastewater surveillance. however, discrepancies in the first detection of the alpha variant between the two approaches highlight that wastewater monitoring can also capture missing information, possibly resulting from asymptomatic cases or communities less engaged with testing programmes, as found by a simultaneous surge testing effort across the city. © 2022 the authors",1,water,0.8292047381401062

2022,impacts of the components of conservation agriculture on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen storage: a global meta-analysis,"conservation agriculture (ca) can be an important strategy for improving soil organic carbon (soc) and total nitrogen (tn). numerous studies have examined soc and tn dynamics in different cropping systems. however, there is some uncertainty regarding the relative impacts of some ca practices, and it is not always clear how other agricultural management, particularly nitrogen addition, interacts with these practices to influence soc and tn sequestration. thus, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 752 comparisons from 97 papers to analyze the impacts of nitrogen fertilizers and ca practices (namely crop diversification, minimal soil disturbance (no-tillage) and permanent soil cover), on soc and tn content worldwide. overall, our study showed the most significant increase of soc [21.39 % (ci = 15.16 to 28.64)] and tn [54.34 % (ci = 26.19 to 96.69)] stock with ca practices compared to conventional practices in the 0–15 cm soil depth. it also showed a significant increase in soc and tn stock with all the individual components of ca compared to conventional practices in the 0–15 cm soil depth. however, the impact of ca on soc and tn is reduced in 0–60 cm depths compared to surface soil depths due to the limited input of crop residue deeper in the soil profile. manure and manure mixed with mineral-n led to greater soc sequestration [20.67 % (ci = 15.23 to 27.10) and 41.67 % (ci = 31.03 to 52.79), respectively] than mineral-n alone [9.08 % (ci = 6.44 to 11.83)]. cropping systems that included legume residue decreased the c/n ratio. this highlights that adequate mineral-n fertilizer addition may also be required in conjunction with residue retention practices to improve soc and tn content. overall, these results show that ca systems that include legume residue and manure mixed with mineral-n have great potential to increase soc and tn, particularly at 0–15 cm and 0–30 cm soil depth. © 2022 elsevier b.v.","impacts of the components of conservation agriculture on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen storage: a global meta-analysis conservation agriculture (ca) can be an important strategy for improving soil organic carbon (soc) and total nitrogen (tn). numerous studies have examined soc and tn dynamics in different cropping systems. however, there is some uncertainty regarding the relative impacts of some ca practices, and it is not always clear how other agricultural management, particularly nitrogen addition, interacts with these practices to influence soc and tn sequestration. thus, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 752 comparisons from 97 papers to analyze the impacts of nitrogen fertilizers and ca practices (namely crop diversification, minimal soil disturbance (no-tillage) and permanent soil cover), on soc and tn content worldwide. overall, our study showed the most significant increase of soc [21.39 % (ci = 15.16 to 28.64)] and tn [54.34 % (ci = 26.19 to 96.69)] stock with ca practices compared to conventional practices in the 0–15 cm soil depth. it also showed a significant increase in soc and tn stock with all the individual components of ca compared to conventional practices in the 0–15 cm soil depth. however, the impact of ca on soc and tn is reduced in 0–60 cm depths compared to surface soil depths due to the limited input of crop residue deeper in the soil profile. manure and manure mixed with mineral-n led to greater soc sequestration [20.67 % (ci = 15.23 to 27.10) and 41.67 % (ci = 31.03 to 52.79), respectively] than mineral-n alone [9.08 % (ci = 6.44 to 11.83)]. cropping systems that included legume residue decreased the c/n ratio. this highlights that adequate mineral-n fertilizer addition may also be required in conjunction with residue retention practices to improve soc and tn content. overall, these results show that ca systems that include legume residue and manure mixed with mineral-n have great potential to increase soc and tn, particularly at 0–15 cm and 0–30 cm soil depth. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",0,soil,0.9742999076843262
2022,removal of gaseous volatile organic compounds by a multiwalled carbon nanotubes/peroxymonosulfate wet scrubber,"in this study, a wet scrubber coupled with a persulfate-based advanced oxidation process [carbocatalysts/peroxymonosulfate (pms)] was demonstrated to efficiently remove gaseous volatile organic compounds (vocs). the removal efficiency of a representative voc, styrene, was stable at above 98%, and an average mineralization rate was achieved at 76% during 2 h. the removal efficiency of the carbocatalysts/pms wet scrubber for styrene was much higher than that of pure water, carbocatalysts/water, or pms/water systems. quenching experiments, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, in-situ raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (dft) calculations indicated that singlet oxygen (1o2) and oxidative complexes are the main reactive oxygen species and that both contributed to styrene removal. in particular, carbonyl groups (c═o) in the carbocatalyst were found to be the active sites for activating pms during styrene oxidation. the role of 1o2was discovered to be benzene ring breaking and a possible non-radical oxidation pathway of styrene was proposed based on time-of-flight mass spectroscopy which was further verified by dft calculations. in particular, the electron transfer process of multi world carbon nanotubes-pms∗ in styrene oxidation was further studied in-depth by experiments and dft calculations. the unstable vinyl on styrene was simultaneously degraded by the oxidative complexes and 1o2into benzene, and finally oxidized by 1o2into h2o and co2. this study provides an effective method for voc removal and clearly illustrates the complete degradation mechanism of styrene in a nonradical pms-based process by a wet scrubber. © 2022 american chemical society. all rights reserved.","removal of gaseous volatile organic compounds by a multiwalled carbon nanotubes/peroxymonosulfate wet scrubber in this study, a wet scrubber coupled with a persulfate-based advanced oxidation process [carbocatalysts/peroxymonosulfate (pms)] was demonstrated to efficiently remove gaseous volatile organic compounds (vocs). the removal efficiency of a representative voc, styrene, was stable at above 98%, and an average mineralization rate was achieved at 76% during 2 h. the removal efficiency of the carbocatalysts/pms wet scrubber for styrene was much higher than that of pure water, carbocatalysts/water, or pms/water systems. quenching experiments, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, in-situ raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (dft) calculations indicated that singlet oxygen (1o2) and oxidative complexes are the main reactive oxygen species and that both contributed to styrene removal. in particular, carbonyl groups (c═o) in the carbocatalyst were found to be the active sites for activating pms during styrene oxidation. the role of 1o2was discovered to be benzene ring breaking and a possible non-radical oxidation pathway of styrene was proposed based on time-of-flight mass spectroscopy which was further verified by dft calculations. in particular, the electron transfer process of multi world carbon nanotubes-pms∗ in styrene oxidation was further studied in-depth by experiments and dft calculations. the unstable vinyl on styrene was simultaneously degraded by the oxidative complexes and 1o2into benzene, and finally oxidized by 1o2into h2o and co2. this study provides an effective method for voc removal and clearly illustrates the complete degradation mechanism of styrene in a nonradical pms-based process by a wet scrubber. © 2022 american chemical society. all rights reserved.",1,water,0.9517779350280762

2022,use of processed sugarcane bagasse ash in concrete as partial replacement of cement: mechanical and durability properties,"using biomass waste as supplementary cementing material (scm) in concrete has attracted researchers’ attention for efficient waste utilization and reducing cement demand. sugarcane bagasse ash (scba) is one such example of biomass waste. it is an agricultural waste obtained when sugarcane bagasse from the sugar industry is used for power generation and disposed of in open-air dumping sites. its waste disposal causes the generation of particulate matter, degrading air quality. in this study, the effect of processed scba as scm in concrete has been investigated. the processing of the scba involved the removal of fibrous and carbon-containing particles by sieving followed by grinding. the scba was ground for 45 min until the surface area was comparable to that of cement and was then used for further characterization and incorporation into concrete. the 45 min grinding time resulted in 2.92 times higher pozzolanic reactivity of the scba. the scba was incorporated by replacing cement in different weight fractions (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%) in concrete. test results showed that the concrete workability increased with scba incorporation, whereas the resulting concrete density was reduced. the results of the mechanical properties, including compressive sstrength and hardened density, were enhanced upon the cement replacement by scba. concrete containing 30% scba can be used for structural applications as its 28 days compressive strength was 21 mpa, which complies with aci 318-16 specifications. concrete resistance against scaling and leaching due to adverse effects of sulfuric and hydrochloric acid considerably increased with scba addition and was due to microstructure densification by secondary hydrates formation as lower portlandite content was detected by thermogravimetric analysis. hence, scba processing increases its reactivity, as reflected by the improved mechanical properties and greater durability of scba-incorporated concrete. © 2022 by the authors.","use of processed sugarcane bagasse ash in concrete as partial replacement of cement: mechanical and durability properties using biomass waste as supplementary cementing material (scm) in concrete has attracted researchers’ attention for efficient waste utilization and reducing cement demand. sugarcane bagasse ash (scba) is one such example of biomass waste. it is an agricultural waste obtained when sugarcane bagasse from the sugar industry is used for power generation and disposed of in open-air dumping sites. its waste disposal causes the generation of particulate matter, degrading air quality. in this study, the effect of processed scba as scm in concrete has been investigated. the processing of the scba involved the removal of fibrous and carbon-containing particles by sieving followed by grinding. the scba was ground for 45 min until the surface area was comparable to that of cement and was then used for further characterization and incorporation into concrete. the 45 min grinding time resulted in 2.92 times higher pozzolanic reactivity of the scba. the scba was incorporated by replacing cement in different weight fractions (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%) in concrete. test results showed that the concrete workability increased with scba incorporation, whereas the resulting concrete density was reduced. the results of the mechanical properties, including compressive sstrength and hardened density, were enhanced upon the cement replacement by scba. concrete containing 30% scba can be used for structural applications as its 28 days compressive strength was 21 mpa, which complies with aci 318-16 specifications. concrete resistance against scaling and leaching due to adverse effects of sulfuric and hydrochloric acid considerably increased with scba addition and was due to microstructure densification by secondary hydrates formation as lower portlandite content was detected by thermogravimetric analysis. hence, scba processing increases its reactivity, as reflected by the improved mechanical properties and greater durability of scba-incorporated concrete. © 2022 by the authors.",2,air,0.8613285422325134

2022,insights into n2o turnovers under polyethylene terephthalate microplastics stress in mainstream biological nitrogen removal process,"the ubiquitous microplastics in wastewater have raised growing concerns due to their unintended effects on microbial activities. however, whether and how microplastics affect nitrous oxide (n2o) (a potent greenhouse gas) turnovers in mainstream biological nitrogen removal (bnr) process remain unclear. this work therefore aimed to fill such knowledge gap by conducting both long-term and batch tests. after over 100 days of feeding with wastewater containing polyethylene terephthalate (pet) microplastics (0–500 μg/l), the long-term results showed that both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification were reduced, as well as the n2o production during nitrification. accordingly, 60% reduction in n2o accumulation and 70% reduction in n2o production were observed in the denitrification and nitrification batch tests, respectively. nevertheless, the long-term n2o emission factors under pet microplastics stress were comparable to that in the control reactor, mainly because pet microplastics led to more nitrite accumulation in anoxic period. with the aid of online n2o sensors and site-preference analysis, it was demonstrated that the heterotrophic bacteria pathway and ammonia oxidizing bacteria denitrification pathway for n2o production were negatively affected by pet microplastics, whereas a clear increase in the contribution of hydroxylamine pathway (+ 22.9%) was observed. further investigation revealed that pet microplastics even at environmental level (i.e. 10 μg/l) significantly reshaped the bnr sludge characteristics (e.g. much larger particle size) and microbial communities (e.g. thauera, rhodobacte and nitrospira) as well as the nitrogen metabolism pathways, which were chiefly responsible for the changes of n2o turnovers and n2o production pathways under the pet microplastics stress. © 2022","insights into n2o turnovers under polyethylene terephthalate microplastics stress in mainstream biological nitrogen removal process the ubiquitous microplastics in wastewater have raised growing concerns due to their unintended effects on microbial activities. however, whether and how microplastics affect nitrous oxide (n2o) (a potent greenhouse gas) turnovers in mainstream biological nitrogen removal (bnr) process remain unclear. this work therefore aimed to fill such knowledge gap by conducting both long-term and batch tests. after over 100 days of feeding with wastewater containing polyethylene terephthalate (pet) microplastics (0–500 μg/l), the long-term results showed that both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification were reduced, as well as the n2o production during nitrification. accordingly, 60% reduction in n2o accumulation and 70% reduction in n2o production were observed in the denitrification and nitrification batch tests, respectively. nevertheless, the long-term n2o emission factors under pet microplastics stress were comparable to that in the control reactor, mainly because pet microplastics led to more nitrite accumulation in anoxic period. with the aid of online n2o sensors and site-preference analysis, it was demonstrated that the heterotrophic bacteria pathway and ammonia oxidizing bacteria denitrification pathway for n2o production were negatively affected by pet microplastics, whereas a clear increase in the contribution of hydroxylamine pathway (+ 22.9%) was observed. further investigation revealed that pet microplastics even at environmental level (i.e. 10 μg/l) significantly reshaped the bnr sludge characteristics (e.g. much larger particle size) and microbial communities (e.g. thauera, rhodobacte and nitrospira) as well as the nitrogen metabolism pathways, which were chiefly responsible for the changes of n2o turnovers and n2o production pathways under the pet microplastics stress. © 2022",1,water,0.884762167930603

2022,"sorption, degradation and microbial toxicity of chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing fluid and produced water in soils","spills of hydraulic fracturing (hf) fluids and of produced water during unconventional gas extraction operations may cause soil contamination. we studied the degradation and microbial toxicity of selected hf chemical components including two biocides (methylisothiozolinone- mit, chloromethylisothiozolinone- cmit), a gel-breaker aid (triethanolamine -tea), and three geogenic chemicals (phenol, m-cresol and p-cresol) in ultrapure water, hf fluid and produced water in five different soil types (surface and subsurface soils). the degradation of the two biocides (in soils treated with hf fluid or ultrapure water) and of the three geogenic chemicals (in soils treated with produced water) was rapid (in all cases dt50 values &lt; 2 days in surface soils). in contrast, the loss of tea was much slower in soils, especially in those treated with hf fluid (dt50 &gt; 30 days). sorption coefficients (koc in l/kg) in these soils ranged from 71 to 733 for tea, 64–408 for mit and 11–72 for cmit. in terms of soil microbial toxicity, exposure to hf fluid and produced water reduced microbial respiration, albeit temporarily. the overall microbial activities in surface soils contaminated with produced water had fully recovered in most soils. in contrast, the hf fluid addition to soils completely inhibited the nitrification in all soils, with little recovery over the 60 day experimental period. in the case of produced water exposure, three out of five surface soils showed complete recovery in nitrification during the study period. the functional genes for nitrogen fixation (nifh) and carbon cycling (ga1) and microbial community composition (16 s rrna) were significantly affected by hf fluid in some soils. overall, the study shows that the hf fluid can have significant detrimental impact on soil microbial functions, especially on nitrogen cycling. more work is needed to identify the exact cause of microbial toxicity in soils contaminated with hf fluid. © 2022","sorption, degradation and microbial toxicity of chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing fluid and produced water in soils spills of hydraulic fracturing (hf) fluids and of produced water during unconventional gas extraction operations may cause soil contamination. we studied the degradation and microbial toxicity of selected hf chemical components including two biocides (methylisothiozolinone- mit, chloromethylisothiozolinone- cmit), a gel-breaker aid (triethanolamine -tea), and three geogenic chemicals (phenol, m-cresol and p-cresol) in ultrapure water, hf fluid and produced water in five different soil types (surface and subsurface soils). the degradation of the two biocides (in soils treated with hf fluid or ultrapure water) and of the three geogenic chemicals (in soils treated with produced water) was rapid (in all cases dt50 values &lt; 2 days in surface soils). in contrast, the loss of tea was much slower in soils, especially in those treated with hf fluid (dt50 &gt; 30 days). sorption coefficients (koc in l/kg) in these soils ranged from 71 to 733 for tea, 64–408 for mit and 11–72 for cmit. in terms of soil microbial toxicity, exposure to hf fluid and produced water reduced microbial respiration, albeit temporarily. the overall microbial activities in surface soils contaminated with produced water had fully recovered in most soils. in contrast, the hf fluid addition to soils completely inhibited the nitrification in all soils, with little recovery over the 60 day experimental period. in the case of produced water exposure, three out of five surface soils showed complete recovery in nitrification during the study period. the functional genes for nitrogen fixation (nifh) and carbon cycling (ga1) and microbial community composition (16 s rrna) were significantly affected by hf fluid in some soils. overall, the study shows that the hf fluid can have significant detrimental impact on soil microbial functions, especially on nitrogen cycling. more work is needed to identify the exact cause of microbial toxicity in soils contaminated with hf fluid. © 2022",0,soil,0.9489321708679199
2022,young population consume twice as much artificial sweetener than the general population – a wastewater-based assessment in china,"understanding artificial sweetener consumption patterns and levels in different demographics is important for formulating public health policies on controlling sugar consumption. there is a considerable knowledge gap with respect to the pattern of artificial sweetener consumption in china. to narrow this gap, wastewater analysis was used to assess the temporal patterns of consumption of seven artificial sweeteners in an urban population and a university town in a megacity in south china over a one-year period. daily influent wastewater samples were collected from an urban catchment and weekly samples collected from a university sub-catchment. population normalized per capita consumption of the four detected artificial sweeteners (cyclamate, acesulfame, sucralose and saccharin) in the university catchment (1.0–5.9 mg d−1 p−1) was much higher than those in urban catchment (0.5–1.3 mg d−1 p−1), indicating younger population consume more artificial sweeteners than the general population. the daily consumption of artificial sweeteners was found to be stable throughout the week in the urban catchment. time-series analysis showed that an average increase in temperature of 1 °c was associated with an increase consumption of 33 μg d−1 p−1 for acesulfame, 15 μg d−1 p−1 for sucralose and 14 μg d−1 p−1 for saccharin. this was the first study that objectively quantified the greater consumption of artificial sweeteners (proxy for consumption of artificially sweetened food and beverages) in a younger age group when compared to the general population, which could potentially pose a risk of health related diseases. © 2022 elsevier b.v.","young population consume twice as much artificial sweetener than the general population – a wastewater-based assessment in china understanding artificial sweetener consumption patterns and levels in different demographics is important for formulating public health policies on controlling sugar consumption. there is a considerable knowledge gap with respect to the pattern of artificial sweetener consumption in china. to narrow this gap, wastewater analysis was used to assess the temporal patterns of consumption of seven artificial sweeteners in an urban population and a university town in a megacity in south china over a one-year period. daily influent wastewater samples were collected from an urban catchment and weekly samples collected from a university sub-catchment. population normalized per capita consumption of the four detected artificial sweeteners (cyclamate, acesulfame, sucralose and saccharin) in the university catchment (1.0–5.9 mg d−1 p−1) was much higher than those in urban catchment (0.5–1.3 mg d−1 p−1), indicating younger population consume more artificial sweeteners than the general population. the daily consumption of artificial sweeteners was found to be stable throughout the week in the urban catchment. time-series analysis showed that an average increase in temperature of 1 °c was associated with an increase consumption of 33 μg d−1 p−1 for acesulfame, 15 μg d−1 p−1 for sucralose and 14 μg d−1 p−1 for saccharin. this was the first study that objectively quantified the greater consumption of artificial sweeteners (proxy for consumption of artificially sweetened food and beverages) in a younger age group when compared to the general population, which could potentially pose a risk of health related diseases. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",1,water,0.9644984006881714

2022,the response of soil-atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange to changing plant litter inputs in terrestrial forest ecosystems,"various global change factors (e.g. elevated co2 concentrations, nitrogen deposition, etc.) can alter the amount of litterfall in terrestrial forests, which could subsequently lead to changes in the physical, chemical, and biological properties of forest soils. yet, there is hitherto a lack of consensus on the role of litter in governing the soil-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases (ghgs) in forest ecosystems, which can significantly affect the overall climatic cooling impacts of forests as a net carbon sink. in this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of over 250 field observations to determine the response of soil ghg fluxes to in situ litter manipulation in global forests. our results showed that overall, litter addition enhanced soil co2 emissions from terrestrial forests by 26%, while litter removal reduced soil co2 emissions from these forests by 26%. the negative response of soil co2 emissions to litter removal was stronger in the tropical forests (−33%) than in the subtropical (−27%) and temperate (−21%) forests, and was significantly correlated with mean annual temperature and precipitation. moreover, litter removal was observed to enhance soil ch4 uptake in tropical (+24%) and temperate (+9%) forests, but not in subtropical forests. litter removal reduced n2o emissions from forest soils by 20% on average, with this negative effect increasing with mean annual precipitation. the duration of litter removal experiment was negatively correlated with the response of soil co2 emissions but had no influence on the response of soil ch4 and n2o fluxes. we found that plant litter supply could alter soil ghg fluxes in forests by modulating the microclimate as well as the labile and recalcitrant soil carbon pools. our findings highlighted the importance of considering the effects of changing plant litter inputs on soil-atmosphere ghg fluxes in terrestrial forests and their spatio-temporal variability in biogeochemical models. © 2022 elsevier b.v.","the response of soil-atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange to changing plant litter inputs in terrestrial forest ecosystems various global change factors (e.g. elevated co2 concentrations, nitrogen deposition, etc.) can alter the amount of litterfall in terrestrial forests, which could subsequently lead to changes in the physical, chemical, and biological properties of forest soils. yet, there is hitherto a lack of consensus on the role of litter in governing the soil-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases (ghgs) in forest ecosystems, which can significantly affect the overall climatic cooling impacts of forests as a net carbon sink. in this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of over 250 field observations to determine the response of soil ghg fluxes to in situ litter manipulation in global forests. our results showed that overall, litter addition enhanced soil co2 emissions from terrestrial forests by 26%, while litter removal reduced soil co2 emissions from these forests by 26%. the negative response of soil co2 emissions to litter removal was stronger in the tropical forests (−33%) than in the subtropical (−27%) and temperate (−21%) forests, and was significantly correlated with mean annual temperature and precipitation. moreover, litter removal was observed to enhance soil ch4 uptake in tropical (+24%) and temperate (+9%) forests, but not in subtropical forests. litter removal reduced n2o emissions from forest soils by 20% on average, with this negative effect increasing with mean annual precipitation. the duration of litter removal experiment was negatively correlated with the response of soil co2 emissions but had no influence on the response of soil ch4 and n2o fluxes. we found that plant litter supply could alter soil ghg fluxes in forests by modulating the microclimate as well as the labile and recalcitrant soil carbon pools. our findings highlighted the importance of considering the effects of changing plant litter inputs on soil-atmosphere ghg fluxes in terrestrial forests and their spatio-temporal variability in biogeochemical models. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",0,soil,0.9096125364303589

2022,uneven crop residue distribution influences soil chemical composition and crop yield under long-term no-tillage,"conservation agriculture has three main components: crop residue retention; minimal soil disturbance;

2022,mechanistic insights into the generation and control of cl-dbps during wastewater sludge chlorination disinfection process,"chlorination disinfection has been widely used to kill the pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater sludge during the special covid-19 period, but sludge chlorination might cause the generation of harmful disinfection byproducts (dbps). in this work, the transformation of extracellular polymeric substance (eps) and mechanisms of cl-dbps generation during sludge disinfection by sodium hypochlorite (naclo) were investigated using multispectral analysis in combination with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (fticr-ms). the microorganism escherichia coli (e. coli) was effectively inactivated by active chlorine generated from naclo. however, a high diversity of cl-dbps were produced with the addition of naclo into sludge, causing the increase of acute toxicity on q67 luminous bacteria of chlorinated eps. a variety of n-containing molecular formulas were produced after chlorination, but n-containing dbps were not detected, which might be the indicative of the dissociation of –nh2 groups after cl-dbps generated. additionally, the release of n-containing compounds was increased in alkaline environment caused by naclo addition, resulted in more cl-dbps generation via nucleophilic substitutions. whereas, less n-compounds and cl-dbps were detected after eps chlorination under acidic environment, leading to lower cell cytotoxicity. therefore, n-containing compounds of lignin derivatives in sludge were the major cl-dbps precursors, and acidic environment could control the release of n-compounds by eliminating the dissociation of functional groups in lignin derivatives, consequently reducing the generation and cytotoxicity of cl-dbps. this study highlights the importance to control the alkalinity of sludge to reduce cl-dbps generation prior to chlorination disinfection process, and ensure the safety of subsequential disposal for wastewater sludge. © 2022 the authors","mechanistic insights into the generation and control of cl-dbps during wastewater sludge chlorination disinfection process chlorination disinfection has been widely used to kill the pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater sludge during the special covid-19 period, but sludge chlorination might cause the generation of harmful disinfection byproducts (dbps). in this work, the transformation of extracellular polymeric substance (eps) and mechanisms of cl-dbps generation during sludge disinfection by sodium hypochlorite (naclo) were investigated using multispectral analysis in combination with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (fticr-ms). the microorganism escherichia coli (e. coli) was effectively inactivated by active chlorine generated from naclo. however, a high diversity of cl-dbps were produced with the addition of naclo into sludge, causing the increase of acute toxicity on q67 luminous bacteria of chlorinated eps. a variety of n-containing molecular formulas were produced after chlorination, but n-containing dbps were not detected, which might be the indicative of the dissociation of –nh2 groups after cl-dbps generated. additionally, the release of n-containing compounds was increased in alkaline environment caused by naclo addition, resulted in more cl-dbps generation via nucleophilic substitutions. whereas, less n-compounds and cl-dbps were detected after eps chlorination under acidic environment, leading to lower cell cytotoxicity. therefore, n-containing compounds of lignin derivatives in sludge were the major cl-dbps precursors, and acidic environment could control the release of n-compounds by eliminating the dissociation of functional groups in lignin derivatives, consequently reducing the generation and cytotoxicity of cl-dbps. this study highlights the importance to control the alkalinity of sludge to reduce cl-dbps generation prior to chlorination disinfection process, and ensure the safety of subsequential disposal for wastewater sludge. © 2022 the authors",1,water,0.8934332132339478

2022,hydrochar amendments stimulate soil nitrous oxide emission by increasing production of hydroxyl radicals and shifting nitrogen functional genes in the short term: a culture experiment,"the application of waste biomass-derived hydrochar to soil may cause extremely intensive nitrous oxide (n2o) fluxes that can challenge our current mechanistic understanding of the global nitrogen cycle in the biosphere. in this study, two waste biomasses were used to prepare cyanobacterial biomas-derived hydrochar (chc) and wheat straw-derived hydrochar (shc) for short-term incubation experiments to identify their effects and mechanisms of waste biomass-derived hydrochar on soil n2o efflux, with time-series samples collected for n2o efflux and soil analysis. the results showed that chc and shc caused short-term bursts of n2o effluxes without nitrogen inputs. moreover, the enrichment of exogenous organics and nutrients at the hydrochar-soil interface was identified as the key factor for enhancing n2o fluxes, which stimulated microbial nitrification (i.e., increased gene copy number of ammonia oxidizing bacteria) and denitrification (i.e., increased gene copy number of nitrate and n2o reducing bacteria) processes. the concentrations of fe (ii) and hydroxyl radicals (ho•) were 6.49 and 5.63 times higher, respectively, in the hydrochar layer of chc than shc amendment. furthermore, structural equation models demonstrated that ho•, as well as soil microbiomes, played an important role in driving n2o fluxes. together, our findings provide a deeper insight into the assessment and prognosis of the short-term environmental risk arising from agricultural waste management in integrated agriculture. further studies under practical field application conditions are warranted to verify the findings. © 2022 elsevier ltd","hydrochar amendments stimulate soil nitrous oxide emission by increasing production of hydroxyl radicals and shifting nitrogen functional genes in the short term: a culture experiment the application of waste biomass-derived hydrochar to soil may cause extremely intensive nitrous oxide (n2o) fluxes that can challenge our current mechanistic understanding of the global nitrogen cycle in the biosphere. in this study, two waste biomasses were used to prepare cyanobacterial biomas-derived hydrochar (chc) and wheat straw-derived hydrochar (shc) for short-term incubation experiments to identify their effects and mechanisms of waste biomass-derived hydrochar on soil n2o efflux, with time-series samples collected for n2o efflux and soil analysis. the results showed that chc and shc caused short-term bursts of n2o effluxes without nitrogen inputs. moreover, the enrichment of exogenous organics and nutrients at the hydrochar-soil interface was identified as the key factor for enhancing n2o fluxes, which stimulated microbial nitrification (i.e., increased gene copy number of ammonia oxidizing bacteria) and denitrification (i.e., increased gene copy number of nitrate and n2o reducing bacteria) processes. the concentrations of fe (ii) and hydroxyl radicals (ho•) were 6.49 and 5.63 times higher, respectively, in the hydrochar layer of chc than shc amendment. furthermore, structural equation models demonstrated that ho•, as well as soil microbiomes, played an important role in driving n2o fluxes. together, our findings provide a deeper insight into the assessment and prognosis of the short-term environmental risk arising from agricultural waste management in integrated agriculture. further studies under practical field application conditions are warranted to verify the findings. © 2022 elsevier ltd",0,soil,0.9876136779785156
2022,influence of c/n ratios on treatment performance and biomass production during co-culture of microalgae and activated sludge,"novel phycosphere associated bacteria processes are being regarded as a potential and cost-effective strategy for controlling anthropogenic contaminants in wastewater treatment. however, the underlying concern with the process is its vulnerability to improper organic or nutrient intake. this study established a synergistic interaction between microalgae and activated sludge in a three-photobioreactor system (without external aeration) to understand how pollutants could be mitigated whilst simultaneously yielding biomass under different c/n ratios of 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1. the result showed that the superior biomass productivity was facilitated at a c/n ratio of 5:1 (106 mg l−1 d−1), and the high degradation rate constants (kcod = 0.25 d−1, ktn = 0.29 d−1, ktp = 0.35 d−1) was approximated using a first-order kinetic model. the removal of pollutants was remarkably high, exceeding 90% (cod), 93% (tn), and 96% (tp). nevertheless, the c/n ratio of 1:1 resulted in a threefold drop in biomass-specific growth rate (μ = 0.07 d−1). microalgal assimilation, followed by bacterial denitrification, is the major pathway of removing total nitrogen when the c/n ratio exceeds 5:1. activated sludge plays an important role in improving microalgae tolerance to high concentration of ammonia nitrogen and boosting nitrification (light phase) and denitrification (dark phase). the use of phycosphere associated bacteria could be a promising strategy for controlling nutrients pollution and other environmental considerations in wastewater. © 2022","influence of c/n ratios on treatment performance and biomass production during co-culture of microalgae and activated sludge novel phycosphere associated bacteria processes are being regarded as a potential and cost-effective strategy for controlling anthropogenic contaminants in wastewater treatment. however, the underlying concern with the process is its vulnerability to improper organic or nutrient intake. this study established a synergistic interaction between microalgae and activated sludge in a three-photobioreactor system (without external aeration) to understand how pollutants could be mitigated whilst simultaneously yielding biomass under different c/n ratios of 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1. the result showed that the superior biomass productivity was facilitated at a c/n ratio of 5:1 (106 mg l−1 d−1), and the high degradation rate constants (kcod = 0.25 d−1, ktn = 0.29 d−1, ktp = 0.35 d−1) was approximated using a first-order kinetic model. the removal of pollutants was remarkably high, exceeding 90% (cod), 93% (tn), and 96% (tp). nevertheless, the c/n ratio of 1:1 resulted in a threefold drop in biomass-specific growth rate (μ = 0.07 d−1). microalgal assimilation, followed by bacterial denitrification, is the major pathway of removing total nitrogen when the c/n ratio exceeds 5:1. activated sludge plays an important role in improving microalgae tolerance to high concentration of ammonia nitrogen and boosting nitrification (light phase) and denitrification (dark phase). the use of phycosphere associated bacteria could be a promising strategy for controlling nutrients pollution and other environmental considerations in wastewater. © 2022",1,water,0.9339109063148499

2022,"determining factors for nitrite accumulation in an acidic nitrifying system: influent ammonium concentration, operational ph, and ammonia-oxidizing community","acidic nitrification is attracting wide attention because it can enable robust suppression of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (nob) in wastewater treatment. this study reports a comprehensive assessment of the novel acidic nitrification process to identify the key factors that govern stable nitrite accumulation. a laboratory-scale moving-bed biofilm reactor receiving low-alkalinity wastewater was continuously operated under acidic conditions (ph &lt; 6) for around two years, including nine stages varying influent and operational conditions. the results revealed that nitrite accumulation was related to three factors, i.e., influent ammonium concentration, operating ph, and ammonia-oxidizing microbial community. these three factors impact nitrite accumulation by altering the in situ concentration of free nitrous acid (fna), which is a potent inhibitor of nob. the critical fna concentration is approximately one part per million (ppm, ∼1 mg hno2-n/l), above which nitrite accumulation is stably maintained in an acidic nitrifying system. the findings of this study suggest that stable nitrite accumulation via acidic ammonia oxidation can be maintained under a range of influent and operational conditions, as long as a ppm-level of fna is established. taking low-strength mainstream wastewater (40-50 mg nh4+-n/l) with limited alkalinity as an example, stable nitrite accumulation was experimentally demonstrated at a ph of 4.35, under which an in situ fna of 2.3 ± 0.6 mg hno2-n/l was attained. under these conditions, candidatus nitrosoglobus became the only ammonia oxidizer detectable by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results of this study deepen our understanding of acidic nitrifying systems, informing further development of novel wastewater treatment technologies. © 2022 american chemical society. all rights reserved.","determining factors for nitrite accumulation in an acidic nitrifying system: influent ammonium concentration, operational ph, and ammonia-oxidizing community acidic nitrification is attracting wide attention because it can enable robust suppression of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (nob) in wastewater treatment. this study reports a comprehensive assessment of the novel acidic nitrification process to identify the key factors that govern stable nitrite accumulation. a laboratory-scale moving-bed biofilm reactor receiving low-alkalinity wastewater was continuously operated under acidic conditions (ph &lt; 6) for around two years, including nine stages varying influent and operational conditions. the results revealed that nitrite accumulation was related to three factors, i.e., influent ammonium concentration, operating ph, and ammonia-oxidizing microbial community. these three factors impact nitrite accumulation by altering the in situ concentration of free nitrous acid (fna), which is a potent inhibitor of nob. the critical fna concentration is approximately one part per million (ppm, ∼1 mg hno2-n/l), above which nitrite accumulation is stably maintained in an acidic nitrifying system. the findings of this study suggest that stable nitrite accumulation via acidic ammonia oxidation can be maintained under a range of influent and operational conditions, as long as a ppm-level of fna is established. taking low-strength mainstream wastewater (40-50 mg nh4+-n/l) with limited alkalinity as an example, stable nitrite accumulation was experimentally demonstrated at a ph of 4.35, under which an in situ fna of 2.3 ± 0.6 mg hno2-n/l was attained. under these conditions, candidatus nitrosoglobus became the only ammonia oxidizer detectable by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results of this study deepen our understanding of acidic nitrifying systems, informing further development of novel wastewater treatment technologies. © 2022 american chemical society. all rights reserved.",1,water,0.8389553427696228
2022,influences and mechanisms of phosphate ions onto persulfate activation and organic degradation in water treatment: a review,"currently, various strategies have been applied to activate persulfate (ps) for contaminant removal from water. however, the background phosphate ions in water affect ps activation and organic degradation, and the mechanism of their influence on the processes is still controversial. in this review, the possible effects of different phosphate forms (hpo42−, h2po4−, and po43−) on ps activation and contaminant degradation were systematically evaluated and summarized. specifically, hpo42− promotes contaminant degradation in direct peroxymonosulfate (pms) oxidation and thermal/pms systems, while it exhibits inhibition to thermal/peroxodisulfate (pds) and ultraviolet (uv)/pds systems. meanwhile, h2po4− inhibits most oxidation processes based on pms and pds, except for non-metal dominated and metal assisted pms systems. coexisting hpo42− and h2po4− could present beneficial effects in thermal, co2+ and non-metal activated and metal assisted pms systems. nevertheless, their inhibitory effects were found in direct pms oxidation, uv/pms (or pds) and metal dominated pms systems. generally, phosphate ions inhibit pms/pds activation through competing adsorption with pms or pds on the solid surface, forming a complex with metal ions, as well as occupying active sites on solid catalysts. in addition, phosphate ions can quench radicals for reduced degradation of contaminants. however, phosphate ions could weaken the bond dissociation energy via combining with pms and contaminants or form a complex with co2+, thus displaying a facilitative effect. this review further discusses major challenges and opportunities of ps activation with co-existing phosphates and will provide guidance for better ps utilization in real water treatment practice. © 2022 elsevier ltd","influences and mechanisms of phosphate ions onto persulfate activation and organic degradation in water treatment: a review currently, various strategies have been applied to activate persulfate (ps) for contaminant removal from water. however, the background phosphate ions in water affect ps activation and organic degradation, and the mechanism of their influence on the processes is still controversial. in this review, the possible effects of different phosphate forms (hpo42−, h2po4−, and po43−) on ps activation and contaminant degradation were systematically evaluated and summarized. specifically, hpo42− promotes contaminant degradation in direct peroxymonosulfate (pms) oxidation and thermal/pms systems, while it exhibits inhibition to thermal/peroxodisulfate (pds) and ultraviolet (uv)/pds systems. meanwhile, h2po4− inhibits most oxidation processes based on pms and pds, except for non-metal dominated and metal assisted pms systems. coexisting hpo42− and h2po4− could present beneficial effects in thermal, co2+ and non-metal activated and metal assisted pms systems. nevertheless, their inhibitory effects were found in direct pms oxidation, uv/pms (or pds) and metal dominated pms systems. generally, phosphate ions inhibit pms/pds activation through competing adsorption with pms or pds on the solid surface, forming a complex with metal ions, as well as occupying active sites on solid catalysts. in addition, phosphate ions can quench radicals for reduced degradation of contaminants. however, phosphate ions could weaken the bond dissociation energy via combining with pms and contaminants or form a complex with co2+, thus displaying a facilitative effect. this review further discusses major challenges and opportunities of ps activation with co-existing phosphates and will provide guidance for better ps utilization in real water treatment practice. © 2022 elsevier ltd",1,water,0.9346519708633423
2022,urea hydrolysis and long-term storage of source-separated urine for reuse as fertiliser is insufficient for the removal of anthropogenic micropollutants,"human and animal source-separated urine, stored and allowed to naturally hydrolyse (the bio-catalysed transformation of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate), has been used for millennia as a fertiliser in agriculture. in a context of growing water scarcity and climate uncertainty, source-separation of urine is facing a strong revival thanks to the emergence of cost-effective waterless collection systems. concomitantly, urine source-separation can be used as a method for nutrient recovery and subsequent reuse. in its simplest form, such recovery consists of collection followed by urea hydrolysis and storage as sole treatment. numerous guidelines, including by the world health organisation, consider that this is sufficient to stabilise the nutrients and inactivate any potential pathogens in the urine. however, it is still unclear whether said urine is effectively free from other compounds of concern, such as anthropogenic micropollutants with known toxicological effects. moreover, it is also currently unknown if the metabolites produced by human consumption of these products behave in similar way during short- and long-term storage i.e. whether any changes in chemical structure mean that these could be sorbed and/or precipitated in a different way, or if they can potentially be degraded by the biomass inherently present in urine collection systems. finally, there is currently no knowledge of whether the observed concentrations of micropollutants in stored hydrolysed urine could potentially have toxicological effects if/when applied to soils and edible crops. to fill these research gaps, 20 commonly consumed compounds were selected in this study and their concentrations in the liquid and solid phases studied in the short- and long-term (up to ≥ 2 years). during the initial process of urea hydrolysis (≤ 5 days), ethyl-glucuronide was the sole compound effectively removed (by deconjugation), while only two other compounds, erythromycin and its metabolite, saw a reduction in their concentration (likely due to biomass sorption). subsequently, during early storage (≤ 15 days), only three additional compounds were removed: paracetamol (> 99%), acesulfame (11.5%) and carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide (40.7%). finally, long-term storage of up to 24 months did not result in any further significant removal for any of the measured compounds, indicating that the procedure of hydrolysis + storage is not effective for the removal of anthropogenic micropollutants. the results of this investigation raise strong concerns about the direct reuse of hydrolysed/stored human

2022,multiple microplastics induced stress on anaerobic granular sludge and an effectively overcoming strategy using hydrochar,"previous studies mostly focused on the responses of anaerobic granular sludge (ags) to one kind of microplastics during wastewater treatment. however, a wide variety of microplastics has been detected in wastewater. the multiple microplastics induced stress on ags and the effectively mitigating strategy still remain unavailable. herein, this work comprehensively excavated the influences of multiple microplastics (i.e., polyethylene terephthalate (pet), polystyrene (ps), polyethylene (pe) and polypropylene (pp)) coexisting in the wastewater on ags system from macroscopic to microcosmic aspects. experimental results illustrated that microplastics decreased ags granule size, increased cell inactivation and caused deteriorative methane recovery from wastewater. as such, this study then put great emphasis on proposing a mitigating strategy using hydrochar and disclosing the role of hydrochar in overcoming the stress induced by coexisting microplastics to ags system. physiological characterization and microbial community analysis demonstrated that hydrochar effectively mitigated the reductions in methane production by 50.6% and cell viability by 68.8% of microplastics-bearing ags and reduced the toxicity of microplastics to microbial community in the ags. mechanisms investigation by fluorescence tagging and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with fluorescence regional integration (eem-fri) analysis revealed that hydrochar adsorbed/accumulated microplastics and enhanced microplastics-bearing ags to secrete extracellular polymeric substance (eps) with more humic acid generation, thus reducing the direct contact between microplastics and ags. in addition, hydrochar weakened the ags intracellular oxidative stress induced by microplastics, thereby completely eliminating the inhibition of microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags, and partially mitigating the suppression on methanation. © 2022","multiple microplastics induced stress on anaerobic granular sludge and an effectively overcoming strategy using hydrochar previous studies mostly focused on the responses of anaerobic granular sludge (ags) to one kind of microplastics during wastewater treatment. however, a wide variety of microplastics has been detected in wastewater. the multiple microplastics induced stress on ags and the effectively mitigating strategy still remain unavailable. herein, this work comprehensively excavated the influences of multiple microplastics (i.e., polyethylene terephthalate (pet), polystyrene (ps), polyethylene (pe) and polypropylene (pp)) coexisting in the wastewater on ags system from macroscopic to microcosmic aspects. experimental results illustrated that microplastics decreased ags granule size, increased cell inactivation and caused deteriorative methane recovery from wastewater. as such, this study then put great emphasis on proposing a mitigating strategy using hydrochar and disclosing the role of hydrochar in overcoming the stress induced by coexisting microplastics to ags system. physiological characterization and microbial community analysis demonstrated that hydrochar effectively mitigated the reductions in methane production by 50.6% and cell viability by 68.8% of microplastics-bearing ags and reduced the toxicity of microplastics to microbial community in the ags. mechanisms investigation by fluorescence tagging and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with fluorescence regional integration (eem-fri) analysis revealed that hydrochar adsorbed/accumulated microplastics and enhanced microplastics-bearing ags to secrete extracellular polymeric substance (eps) with more humic acid generation, thus reducing the direct contact between microplastics and ags. in addition, hydrochar weakened the ags intracellular oxidative stress induced by microplastics, thereby completely eliminating the inhibition of microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags, and partially mitigating the suppression on methanation. © 2022",1,water,0.8399593830108643
2022,rainfall leads to elevated levels of antibiotic resistance genes within seawater at an australian beach,"anthropogenic waste streams can be major sources of antibiotic resistant microbes within the environment, creating a potential risk to public health. we examined patterns in the occurrence of a suite of antibiotic resistance genes (args) and their links to enteric bacteria at a popular swimming beach in australia that experiences intermittent contamination by sewage, with potential points of input including stormwater drains and a coastal lagoon. samples were collected throughout a significant rainfall event (40.8 mm over 3 days) and analysed using both qpcr and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing. before the rainfall event, low levels of faecal indicator bacteria and a microbial source tracking human faeces (sewage) marker (lachno3) were observed. these levels increased over 10x following rainfall. within lagoon, drain and seawater samples, levels of the args suli, dfra1 and qnrs increased by between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude after 20.4 mm of rain, while levels of teta increased by an order of magnitude after a total of 40.8 mm. after 40.8 mm of rain suli, teta and qnrs could be detected 300 m offshore with levels remaining high five days after the rain event. highest levels of sewage markers and args were observed adjacent to the lagoon (when opened) and in-front of the stormwater drains, pinpointing these as the points of arg input. significant positive correlations were observed between all args, and a suite of amplicon sequence variants that were identified as stormwater drain indicator taxa using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing data. of note, some stormwater drain indicator taxa, which exhibited correlations to arg abundance, included the human pathogens arcobacter butzleri and bacteroides fragilis. given that previous research has linked high levels of args in recreationally used environments to antimicrobial resistant pathogen infections, the observed patterns indicate a potentially elevated human health risk at a popular swimming beach following significant rainfall events. © 2022 elsevier ltd","rainfall leads to elevated levels of antibiotic resistance genes within seawater at an australian beach anthropogenic waste streams can be major sources of antibiotic resistant microbes within the environment, creating a potential risk to public health. we examined patterns in the occurrence of a suite of antibiotic resistance genes (args) and their links to enteric bacteria at a popular swimming beach in australia that experiences intermittent contamination by sewage, with potential points of input including stormwater drains and a coastal lagoon. samples were collected throughout a significant rainfall event (40.8 mm over 3 days) and analysed using both qpcr and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing. before the rainfall event, low levels of faecal indicator bacteria and a microbial source tracking human faeces (sewage) marker (lachno3) were observed. these levels increased over 10x following rainfall. within lagoon, drain and seawater samples, levels of the args suli, dfra1 and qnrs increased by between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude after 20.4 mm of rain, while levels of teta increased by an order of magnitude after a total of 40.8 mm. after 40.8 mm of rain suli, teta and qnrs could be detected 300 m offshore with levels remaining high five days after the rain event. highest levels of sewage markers and args were observed adjacent to the lagoon (when opened) and in-front of the stormwater drains, pinpointing these as the points of arg input. significant positive correlations were observed between all args, and a suite of amplicon sequence variants that were identified as stormwater drain indicator taxa using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing data. of note, some stormwater drain indicator taxa, which exhibited correlations to arg abundance, included the human pathogens arcobacter butzleri and bacteroides fragilis. given that previous research has linked high levels of args in recreationally used environments to antimicrobial resistant pathogen infections, the observed patterns indicate a potentially elevated human health risk at a popular swimming beach following significant rainfall events. © 2022 elsevier ltd",2,air,0.8588122725486755

2022,three-year consecutive field application of erythromycin fermentation residue following hydrothermal treatment: cumulative effect on soil antibiotic resistance genes,"fermentation-based antibiotic production results in abundant nutrient-rich fermentation residue with high potential for recycling, but the high antibiotic residual concentration restricts its usefulness (e.g., in land application as organic fertilizer). in this study, an industrial-scale hydrothermal facility for the treatment of erythromycin fermentation residue (efr) was investigated, and the potential risk of the long-term soil application of treated efr promoting environmental antibiotic resistance development was evaluated. the treatment effectively removed bacteria and their dna, and an erythromycin removal ratio of up to approximately 98% was achieved. the treated efr was utilized as organic fertilizer for consecutive field applications from 2018 to 2020, with dosages ranging from 3750 to 15 000 kg∙hm−2, resulting in sub-inhibitory levels of erythromycin (ranging from 0.83–76.00 μg∙kg−1) in soils. metagenomic shotgun sequencing was then used to characterize the antibiotic resistance genes (args), mobile genetic elements (mges), and bacterial community composition of the soils. the soil arg abundance and diversity did not respond to the treated efr application in the first year, but gradually changed in the second and third year of application. the highest fold change in relative abundance of macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin (mls) and total args were 12.59 and 2.75 times, compared with the control (ck; without application), respectively. the soil mges and taxonomic composition showed similar temporal trends to those of the args, and appeared to assist in driving increasing arg proliferation, as revealed by correlation analysis and structural equation models (sems). the relative abundance of particular erm resistance genes (rna methyltransferase genes) increased significantly in the third year of treated efr application. the close association of erm with mges suggested that horizontal gene transfer played a critical role in the observed erm gene enrichment. metagenomic binning results demonstrated that the proliferation of mac gene-carrying hosts was responsible for the increased abundance of mac genes (efflux pump genes). this study shows that sub-inhibitory levels of erythromycin in soils had a cumulative effect on soil args over time and emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring for assessing the risk of soil amendment with treated industrial waste. © 2022 the authors","three-year consecutive field application of erythromycin fermentation residue following hydrothermal treatment: cumulative effect on soil antibiotic resistance genes fermentation-based antibiotic production results in abundant nutrient-rich fermentation residue with high potential for recycling, but the high antibiotic residual concentration restricts its usefulness (e.g., in land application as organic fertilizer). in this study, an industrial-scale hydrothermal facility for the treatment of erythromycin fermentation residue (efr) was investigated, and the potential risk of the long-term soil application of treated efr promoting environmental antibiotic resistance development was evaluated. the treatment effectively removed bacteria and their dna, and an erythromycin removal ratio of up to approximately 98% was achieved. the treated efr was utilized as organic fertilizer for consecutive field applications from 2018 to 2020, with dosages ranging from 3750 to 15 000 kg∙hm−2, resulting in sub-inhibitory levels of erythromycin (ranging from 0.83–76.00 μg∙kg−1) in soils. metagenomic shotgun sequencing was then used to characterize the antibiotic resistance genes (args), mobile genetic elements (mges), and bacterial community composition of the soils. the soil arg abundance and diversity did not respond to the treated efr application in the first year, but gradually changed in the second and third year of application. the highest fold change in relative abundance of macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin (mls) and total args were 12.59 and 2.75 times, compared with the control (ck;

2022,microstructural investigation of thermo-mechanically processed lithium slag for geopolymer precursor using various characterization techniques,"lithium slag is an emerging industrial waste due to the increasing demand for lithium rechargeable batteries attributed to the recent boom in the automobile industry and space exploration. it is extracted as a powder residue in sedimentary tanks after the refining process of lithium extraction. in this study, the effect of thermo-mechanical processing on the chemical reactivity of lithium slag is assessed by tescan integrated mineral analyzer (tima), x-ray fluorescence (xrf), rietveld quantitative refinement techniques. the chemical, mineral, and crystallographic phase composition of processed lithium slag specimens were assessed and compared by xrf, tima, and rietveld quantitative refinement techniques, respectively. the results of thermo-mechanical processing indicated that the mineral and crystallographic transformation of spodumene to feldspars (anorthite, muscovite, albite) occurred by crystallite agglomeration. the chemical reactivity of lithium slag is gauged in terms of amorphous alumino-silicates present in feldspars and unidentified phases. characterization of unidentified phase is evident that it majorly contains micro-nano sized alumino-silicate rich particles with similar spectral signatures to that of feldspar, some fraction of it is aggregated into other phases due to its reactivity. the concentration of the amorphous phase is proportionate with the thermo-mechanical processing energy. however, the thermo-mechanical processing energy is also optimized based on the generation of amorphous phase and reduction in particle size. therefore, the g1c700 processed regime resulted in one of the maximum amounts of amorphous phase (52.60%). the mineral phase transformation of spodumene to anorthite (+10.46%) and unidentified phase (+8.24%) along with d50 value of 13.26 µm, consequently releasing 0.45 kg of carbon emissions upon thermo-mechanical processing. hence, g1c700 lithium slag is recommended for its use as a geopolymer precursor. © 2022 elsevier ltd","microstructural investigation of thermo-mechanically processed lithium slag for geopolymer precursor using various characterization techniques lithium slag is an emerging industrial waste due to the increasing demand for lithium rechargeable batteries attributed to the recent boom in the automobile industry and space exploration. it is extracted as a powder residue in sedimentary tanks after the refining process of lithium extraction. in this study, the effect of thermo-mechanical processing on the chemical reactivity of lithium slag is assessed by tescan integrated mineral analyzer (tima), x-ray fluorescence (xrf), rietveld quantitative refinement techniques. the chemical, mineral, and crystallographic phase composition of processed lithium slag specimens were assessed and compared by xrf, tima, and rietveld quantitative refinement techniques, respectively. the results of thermo-mechanical processing indicated that the mineral and crystallographic transformation of spodumene to feldspars (anorthite, muscovite, albite) occurred by crystallite agglomeration. the chemical reactivity of lithium slag is gauged in terms of amorphous alumino-silicates present in feldspars and unidentified phases. characterization of unidentified phase is evident that it majorly contains micro-nano sized alumino-silicate rich particles with similar spectral signatures to that of feldspar, some fraction of it is aggregated into other phases due to its reactivity. the concentration of the amorphous phase is proportionate with the thermo-mechanical processing energy. however, the thermo-mechanical processing energy is also optimized based on the generation of amorphous phase and reduction in particle size. therefore, the g1c700 processed regime resulted in one of the maximum amounts of amorphous phase (52.60%). the mineral phase transformation of spodumene to anorthite (+10.46%) and unidentified phase (+8.24%) along with d50 value of 13.26 µm, consequently releasing 0.45 kg of carbon emissions upon thermo-mechanical processing. hence, g1c700 lithium slag is recommended for its use as a geopolymer precursor. © 2022 elsevier ltd",4,chemical,0.8483753204345703

2022,"impact of source-separation of urine on treatment capacity, process design, and capital expenditure of a decentralised wastewater treatment plant","in this study, the impact of urine diversion on the treatment capacity, treatment process, and capital costs of a decentralised wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) was simulated using biowin. the data for simulation including for economic analysis were obtained from a real decentralised wwtp at sydney. simulation was conducted for two alternative process design scenarios of a wwtp: membrane bioreactor (mbr) without denitrification and anaerobic mbr in place of aerobic mbr and compared to existing process design. the simulation shows that with about 75% urine diversion (through source separation), the treatment capacity of the existing wwtp can be doubled although above 40% urine diversion, the impact appears less rapid. when the urine diversion exceeds 75%, it was found that the anoxic tank for biological denitrification becomes redundant and the current wastewater treatment process could be replaced with a simpler and much less aeration intensive membrane bioreactor (mbr) producing similar effluent quality with a 24% reduction in capital expenditure (footprint) cost. anaerobic mbr can be a potential alternative to aerobic mbr although pre-treatment becomes essential before reverse osmosis treatment for water reuse applications. sensitivity analysis has revealed that by operating the bioreactor at higher mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations (9 g/l instead of 5 g/l) could help increase the wwtp treatment capacity by about 3.5 times at 75% urine diversion. hence, urine diversion (until nitrogen-limiting conditions occur above 75% urine diversion) can increase the treatment capacity of an existing wwtp and reduce the capital expenses due to reduced plant footprint. © 2022","impact of source-separation of urine on treatment capacity, process design, and capital expenditure of a decentralised wastewater treatment plant in this study, the impact of urine diversion on the treatment capacity, treatment process, and capital costs of a decentralised wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) was simulated using biowin. the data for simulation including for economic analysis were obtained from a real decentralised wwtp at sydney. simulation was conducted for two alternative process design scenarios of a wwtp: membrane bioreactor (mbr) without denitrification and anaerobic mbr in place of aerobic mbr and compared to existing process design. the simulation shows that with about 75% urine diversion (through source separation), the treatment capacity of the existing wwtp can be doubled although above 40% urine diversion, the impact appears less rapid. when the urine diversion exceeds 75%, it was found that the anoxic tank for biological denitrification becomes redundant and the current wastewater treatment process could be replaced with a simpler and much less aeration intensive membrane bioreactor (mbr) producing similar effluent quality with a 24% reduction in capital expenditure (footprint) cost. anaerobic mbr can be a potential alternative to aerobic mbr although pre-treatment becomes essential before reverse osmosis treatment for water reuse applications. sensitivity analysis has revealed that by operating the bioreactor at higher mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations (9 g/l instead of 5 g/l) could help increase the wwtp treatment capacity by about 3.5 times at 75% urine diversion. hence, urine diversion (until nitrogen-limiting conditions occur above 75% urine diversion) can increase the treatment capacity of an existing wwtp and reduce the capital expenses due to reduced plant footprint. © 2022",1,water,0.8734654784202576

this study, a novel bioaugmentation strategy was developed by using halophilic martelella sp. ad-3 for effectively augmented phenanthrene (phe) degradation under 3% salinity. it was found that a 0.5∼1.5% (w/w) ratio of strain ad-3 to activated sludge was optimal for achieving high phe degradation activity of the bs system with degradation rates reaching 2.2 mg⋅gvss−1⋅h−1, nearly 25 times that of the as system. although 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (1h2n) was accumulated obviously, the mineralization of phe was more complete in the bs system. reads-based metagenomic coupled metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that the expression values of ndob, encoding a dioxygenase associated with phe ring-cleavage, was 5600-fold higher in the bs system than in the as system. metagenome assembly showed the members of the corynebacterium and alcaligenes genera were abundant in the strain ad-3 bioaugmented bs system with expression of 10.3±1.8% and 1.9±0.26%, respectively. moreover, phdi and nahg accused for metabolism of 1h2n have been annotated in both above two genera. degradation assays of intermediates of phe confirmed that the activated sludge actually possessed considerable degradation capacity for downstream intermediates of phe including 1h2n. the degradation capacity ratio of 1h2n to phe was 87% in bs system, while it was 26% in strain ad-3. these results indicated that strain

2022,treatment of synthetic dye containing textile raw wastewater effluent using uv/chlorine/br photolysis process followed by activated carbon adsorption,"this study investigated the efficiency and feasibility of ultraviolet (uv)-assisted photolysis of synthetic dye containing textile raw wastewater effluent. for a said purpose, in-house developed uv/chlorine/br process was followed in the presence of activated carbon (ac) which additionally facilitate the dye adsorption. in uv/chlorine process cl•, cl2•−, and ho• are generated in the solution and destroyed compounds that cannot be oxidized by the conventional oxidant. in this process, free bromine is formed and photolyzed by uv radiation and generate br• and br2•– that can enhance the rate of pollutant degradation. in the present study, the dye removal efficiency was contributed by dark bromide (7.18%), uv irradiation (26.8%), dark chlorination (78.67%), and uv/chlorine/br (87.01%), respectively. with increasing ph from 3.0 to 8.30, the dye removal efficiency was enhanced but decreased by further increasing ph values. in addition, magnetized activated carbon from pomegranate husk using dual-stage chemical activation was used for post-adsorption of the residual dye and its degradation byproducts. the adsorption of the dye residues by ac followed the second-order kinetics with the rate constant of 1.7 × 10–3. the phytotoxicity of the treated textile wastewater by uv irradiation, dark chlorination, and uv/chlorine/br was assessed by seed germination of lepidium sativum seeds. the highest inhibition effect on seed germination was related to treated wastewater by uv irradiation (more than 90% inhibition) that alleviated to less than 10% when this effluent diluted to 5% v/v. the highest germination was observed when the seeds were irrigated by the effluent of the uv/chlorine/br process. the significant reduction in the toxicity of the treated wastewater revealed that the uv/chlorine/br process has a considerable potential to effectively detoxify textile wastewater.

2022,expanding asm models towards integrated processes for short-cut nitrogen removal and bioplastic recovery,"in next-generation water resource recovery facilities (wrrfs), it is becoming increasingly important to save energy costs and promote resource recovery of valuable products. one way of reducing the substantial aeration energy costs at wrrfs is to employ shortcut n removal, while polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) production and recovery as bioplastic is a promising means of recovering a valuable product from biosolids. both objectives can be achieved simultaneously through the short-cut enhanced phosphorus and pha recovery (scepphar) process. however, current mathematical models have not previously been employed to describe the behavior of such a process, which limits engineering design and optimisation of process operation. this work focusses on extending the asm3 model towards the description of short-cut nitrogen removal and simultaneous pha recovery in a sidestream treatment process. the calibrated and validated model described very well the nitritation process coupled with the aerobic feast/anoxic famine process for the selection of pha producing organisms at a pilot-scale facility operated in carbonera, italy, where the normalised root mean squared error (nrmse) was consistently <20%. furthermore, the model applied to the pha selection stage could effectively describe the pha accumulation stage without recalibration. a simulation study was performed using the modified asm3 model to assess the relative benefits of the scepphar process strategy as compared to the fully aerobic selection process for mixed culture pha production. while the level of pha production was found to be 34% lower with scepphar, a 43% savings in volatile fatty acids (vfas) demand, a 15% decrease in total suspended solids (tss) production and a 28% decrease in oxygen demand were also achievable, which could lead to savings in operational costs. this study facilitates the design and optimisation of wrrfs that integrate short-cut n removal with pha production, saving aeration energy costs while achieving resource recovery. © 2022 elsevier b.v.","expanding asm models towards integrated processes for short-cut nitrogen removal and bioplastic recovery in next-generation water resource recovery facilities (wrrfs), it is becoming increasingly important to save energy costs and promote resource recovery of valuable products. one way of reducing the substantial aeration energy costs at wrrfs is to employ shortcut n removal, while polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) production and recovery as bioplastic is a promising means of recovering a valuable product from biosolids. both objectives can be achieved simultaneously through the short-cut enhanced phosphorus and pha recovery (scepphar) process. however, current mathematical models have not previously been employed to describe the behavior of such a process, which limits engineering design and optimisation of process operation. this work focusses on extending the asm3 model towards the description of short-cut nitrogen removal and simultaneous pha recovery in a sidestream treatment process. the calibrated and validated model described very well the nitritation process coupled with the aerobic feast/anoxic famine process for the selection of pha producing organisms at a pilot-scale facility operated in carbonera, italy, where the normalised root mean squared error (nrmse) was consistently <20%. furthermore, the model applied to the pha selection stage could effectively describe the pha accumulation stage without recalibration. a simulation study was performed using the modified asm3 model to assess the relative benefits of the scepphar process strategy as compared to the fully aerobic selection process for mixed culture pha production. while the level of pha production was found to be 34% lower with scepphar, a 43% savings in volatile fatty acids (vfas) demand, a 15% decrease in total suspended solids (tss) production and a 28% decrease in oxygen demand were also achievable, which could lead to savings in operational costs. this study facilitates the design and optimisation of wrrfs that integrate short-cut n removal with pha production, saving aeration energy costs while achieving resource recovery. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",1,water,0.8847728967666626

2022,"copyrolysis of food waste and rice husk to biochar to create a sustainable resource for soil amendment: a pilot-scale case study in jinhua, china","worldwide, massive amounts of food waste have been generated at increasingly accelerated rates, posing potentially great risks to the environment. shifting traditional waste treatment to a sustainable bioeconomy thus challenges food chain management worldwide. in this study, food waste was copyrolyzed with rice husk to produce biochar with a pilot-scale industrialized system. the efficiency of the material conversion and the properties and functions of the produced biochars as well as the potential environmental impacts of pyrolysis were evaluated using in situ measurements, physico-chemical characterization and in vitro (pot) experiments with biochar. the results showed that the emissions of potential toxic compounds and metals from the pyrolysis system were within the guideline limits under the legislation of china or the eu commission. on average, biochar yielded approximately 20% of feedstock and contained a total organic carbon content of 433 g kg−1. in the pot experiment, chinese cabbage yield and quality were significantly improved, and the plant uptake of heavy metals was significantly reduced in soil amended with food waste biochar compared to no biochar amendment. furthermore, the food waste biochar was blended with mineral nutrients to create a biochar based compounded n-p-k fertilizer. application of the biochar based compound fertilizer exerted a significant positive effect on cabbage growth and nutrient use efficiency relative to a conventional mineral compound fertilizer. for per tonne of dry mass of food waste, copyrolysis costed less than 60 usd but gained a gross profit of more than 30 usd. therefore, the copyrolysis of food waste with crop residues could be applicable to the safe recycling of food waste into value added products to raise agricultural production. © 2022 elsevier ltd","copyrolysis of food waste and rice husk to biochar to create a sustainable resource for soil amendment: a pilot-scale case study in jinhua, china worldwide, massive amounts of food waste have been generated at increasingly accelerated rates, posing potentially great risks to the environment. shifting traditional waste treatment to a sustainable bioeconomy thus challenges food chain management worldwide. in this study, food waste was copyrolyzed with rice husk to produce biochar with a pilot-scale industrialized system. the efficiency of the material conversion and the properties and functions of the produced biochars as well as the potential environmental impacts of pyrolysis were evaluated using in situ measurements, physico-chemical characterization and in vitro (pot) experiments with biochar. the results showed that the emissions of potential toxic compounds and metals from the pyrolysis system were within the guideline limits under the legislation of china or the eu commission. on average, biochar yielded approximately 20% of feedstock and contained a total organic carbon content of 433 g kg−1. in the pot experiment, chinese cabbage yield and quality were significantly improved, and the plant uptake of heavy metals was significantly reduced in soil amended with food waste biochar compared to no biochar amendment. furthermore, the food waste biochar was blended with mineral nutrients to create a biochar based compounded n-p-k fertilizer. application of the biochar based compound fertilizer exerted a significant positive effect on cabbage growth and nutrient use efficiency relative to a conventional mineral compound fertilizer. for per tonne of dry mass of food waste, copyrolysis costed less than 60 usd but gained a gross profit of more than 30 usd. therefore, the copyrolysis of food waste with crop residues could be applicable to the safe recycling of food waste into value added products to raise agricultural production. © 2022 elsevier ltd",0,soil,0.9676700830459595
2022,closing the circle for urban food waste anaerobic digestion: the use of digestate and biochar on plant growth in potting soil,"food waste can be used via anaerobic digestion (ad) to produce biogas. the liquid by-product (digestate) contains nitrogen (mainly as ammonium) which is susceptible to n loss as a fertiliser and also faces logistical constraints for agricultural use. biochar can adsorb and retain nutrients and alter microbial n-cycling processes. we investigated the use of digestate as a nutrient source and its interactions with biochar when applied to potting mix targeted for localised urban use. tomato (solanum lycopersicum l.) plants were grown for 45 days in potting mix amended with five rates of food-waste-derived digestate (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% v/v), with and without biochar (10% v/v). at harvest, plant growth parameters and potting soil characteristics were measured. the rhizosphere bacterial community was profiled by amplicon sequencing followed by an in-silico analysis of putative functional genes. plant biomass and shoot n concentration increased with digestate addition in a typical nutrient dose-response curve. while growth lagged when digestate was combined with biochar, both treatments reached a similar maximum shoot yield. biochar application decreased soil mineral n content and two putative ammonium nitrification cycling genes, amoa and amob, which prevent the conversion of no3- from nh4+. rhizosphere bacteria beta-diversity separated into two distinct clusters, with and without biochar, at all levels of digestate. addition of biochar with digestate decreased the availability of soil mineral n by decreasing the mineralisation of nitrogen which likely reduced the risk of n loss. the rhizosheath bacterial community mediated this effect. further quantification of these processes may aid in optimising of the benefits for the environment and plant growth from the transformation of blended organic urban wastes into organic fertilisers for potting soils. © 2022 elsevier ltd","closing the circle for urban food waste anaerobic digestion: the use of digestate and biochar on plant growth in potting soil food waste can be used via anaerobic digestion (ad) to produce biogas. the liquid by-product (digestate) contains nitrogen (mainly as ammonium) which is susceptible to n loss as a fertiliser and also faces logistical constraints for agricultural use. biochar can adsorb and retain nutrients and alter microbial n-cycling processes. we investigated the use of digestate as a nutrient source and its interactions with biochar when applied to potting mix targeted for localised urban use. tomato (solanum lycopersicum l.) plants were grown for 45 days in potting mix amended with five rates of food-waste-derived digestate (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% v/v), with and without biochar (10% v/v). at harvest, plant growth parameters and potting soil characteristics were measured. the rhizosphere bacterial community was profiled by amplicon sequencing followed by an in-silico analysis of putative functional genes. plant biomass and shoot n concentration increased with digestate addition in a typical nutrient dose-response curve. while growth lagged when digestate was combined with biochar, both treatments reached a similar maximum shoot yield. biochar application decreased soil mineral n content and two putative ammonium nitrification cycling genes, amoa and amob, which prevent the conversion of no3- from nh4+. rhizosphere bacteria beta-diversity separated into two distinct clusters, with and without biochar, at all levels of digestate. addition of biochar with digestate decreased the availability of soil mineral n by decreasing the mineralisation of nitrogen which likely reduced the risk of n loss. the rhizosheath bacterial community mediated this effect. further quantification of these processes may aid in optimising of the benefits for the environment and plant growth from the transformation of blended organic urban wastes into organic fertilisers for potting soils. © 2022 elsevier ltd",0,soil,0.9896104335784912

2022,helium recovery and purification by dual reflux pressure swing adsorption,"global demand for helium has risen over the past few decades driven by a vast range of applications based on its unique properties. helium is often produced industrially from the vent streams of nitrogen rejection units (nru) in liquefied natural gas (lng) plants, where it accumulates because of its low boiling point. further deep cryogenic processing stages are then required to upgrade its concentration to saleable levels. we report here an experimental and simulation-based investigation of an alternative, non-cryogenic process based on dual reflux pressure swing adsorption (dr psa) cycles to recover and purify helium from model binaries including a 1 mol% he + 99 mol% n2 mixture representative of nru vent streams. binderfree zeolite 13x was used as the adsorbent in an experimental campaign employing a laboratory-scale dr psa apparatus. the experimental runs validated a non-isothermal numerical model with an average deviation of 1 mol% between the simulated and experimental product compositions. the single-stage dr psa experiments produced helium product streams with purities ranging from (30 to 99) mol% from feeds with concentrations ranging from (1 to 50) mol% he. two dr psa stages were required to upgrade mixtures containing 1 mol% he to a target product purity of &gt; 99 mol%. a cascade arrangement of two dr psa systems with a waste recycle enabled a 99.999 mol% he purity product at 95 % recovery, which is competitive with conventional cryogenic systems. this cascade dr psa process used either two or three compressors depending on the feed gas pressure, with associated duty costs of 1.5 mj∙(mol he produced)–1. this is lower than several membrane processes described in the literature and could be more cost-effective for smaller-scale applications than cryogenic processes with similar levels of separation performance. © 2022 elsevier b.v.","helium recovery and purification by dual reflux pressure swing adsorption global demand for helium has risen over the past few decades driven by a vast range of applications based on its unique properties. helium is often produced industrially from the vent streams of nitrogen rejection units (nru) in liquefied natural gas (lng) plants, where it accumulates because of its low boiling point. further deep cryogenic processing stages are then required to upgrade its concentration to saleable levels. we report here an experimental and simulation-based investigation of an alternative, non-cryogenic process based on dual reflux pressure swing adsorption (dr psa) cycles to recover and purify helium from model binaries including a 1 mol% he + 99 mol% n2 mixture representative of nru vent streams. binderfree zeolite 13x was used as the adsorbent in an experimental campaign employing a laboratory-scale dr psa apparatus. the experimental runs validated a non-isothermal numerical model with an average deviation of 1 mol% between the simulated and experimental product compositions. the single-stage dr psa experiments produced helium product streams with purities ranging from (30 to 99) mol% from feeds with concentrations ranging from (1 to 50) mol% he. two dr psa stages were required to upgrade mixtures containing 1 mol% he to a target product purity of &gt; 99 mol%. a cascade arrangement of two dr psa systems with a waste recycle enabled a 99.999 mol% he purity product at 95 % recovery, which is competitive with conventional cryogenic systems. this cascade dr psa process used either two or three compressors depending on the feed gas pressure, with associated duty costs of 1.5 mj∙(mol he produced)–1. this is lower than several membrane processes described in the literature and could be more cost-effective for smaller-scale applications than cryogenic processes with similar levels of separation performance. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",2,air,0.8816334009170532

2022,functionalizing biochar by co-pyrolysis shaddock peel with red mud for removing acid orange 7 from water,"biochar modification by metal/metal oxide is promising for improving its adsorption capability for contaminants, especially the anions. however, conventional chemical modifications are complicated and costly. in this study, novel fe/fe oxide loaded biochars (rmbcs) were synthesized from a one-step co-pyrolysis of red mud (rm) and shaddock peel (sp), and their potential application for removing anionic azo dye (acid orange 7, ao7) from the aqueous environment was evaluated. fe from red mud was successfully loaded onto biochars pyrolyzed at 300–800 °c, which presented from oxidation form (fe2o3) to the reduction forms (feo and fe0) with increasing pyrolysis temperature. the rmbc produced at 800 °c with rm:sp mass ratio of 1:1 (rmbc8001:1) exhibited the best capability for ao7 removal (∼32 mg/g), attributed to both adsorption and degradation. the higher surface area of rmbc8001:1 and its greater affinity for ao7 led to the higher adsorption. in addition, rmbc8001:1-induced degradation of ao7 was another key mechanism for ao7 removal. the reduction forms of fe (feo or fe0) in rmbc8001:1 may provide electrons for breaking down the azo bond in ao7 molecules and result in degradation, which is further enhanced in acid conditions due to the participation of readily release of fe2+ and the available h+ in ao7 degradation. furthermore, rmbc8001:1 can be easily separated from the treated water by using magnetic field, which significantly benefits its separation in wastewater treatment. © 2022 elsevier ltd","functionalizing biochar by co-pyrolysis shaddock peel with red mud for removing acid orange 7 from water biochar modification by metal/metal oxide is promising for improving its adsorption capability for contaminants, especially the anions. however, conventional chemical modifications are complicated and costly. in this study, novel fe/fe oxide loaded biochars (rmbcs) were synthesized from a one-step co-pyrolysis of red mud (rm) and shaddock peel (sp), and their potential application for removing anionic azo dye (acid orange 7, ao7) from the aqueous environment was evaluated. fe from red mud was successfully loaded onto biochars pyrolyzed at 300–800 °c, which presented from oxidation form (fe2o3) to the reduction forms (feo and fe0) with increasing pyrolysis temperature. the rmbc produced at 800 °c with rm:sp mass ratio of 1:1 (rmbc8001:1) exhibited the best capability for ao7 removal (∼32 mg/g), attributed to both adsorption and degradation. the higher surface area of rmbc8001:1 and its greater affinity for ao7 led to the higher adsorption. in addition, rmbc8001:1-induced degradation of ao7 was another key mechanism for ao7 removal. the reduction forms of fe (feo or fe0) in rmbc8001:1 may provide electrons for breaking down the azo bond in ao7 molecules and result in degradation, which is further enhanced in acid conditions due to the participation of readily release of fe2+ and the available h+ in ao7 degradation. furthermore, rmbc8001:1 can be easily separated from the treated water by using magnetic field, which significantly benefits its separation in wastewater treatment. © 2022 elsevier ltd",1,water,0.8721945285797119

2022,enhancement of pha production by a mixed microbial culture using vfa obtained from the fermentation of wastewater from yeast industry,"wastewater from the yeast production industry (wwy) is potentially harmful to surface water due to its high nitrogen and organic matter content; it can be used to produce compounds of higher commercial value, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (pha). pha are polyester-type biopolymers synthesized by bacteria as energy reservoirs that can potentially substitute petrochemical-derived plastics. in this exploratory work, effluent from wwy was used to produce pha, using a three-step setup of mixed microbial cultures involving one anaerobic and two aerobic reactors. first, volatile fatty acids (vfa; 2.5 g/l) were produced on an anaerobic batch reactor (reactor a) fed with wwy, using a heat pretreated sludge inoculum to eliminate methanogenic activity. concurrently, pha-producing bacteria were enriched using synthetic vfa in a sequencing batch reactor (sbr, reactor c) operated for 78 days. finally, a polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-producing reactor (reactor b) was assembled using the inoculum enriched with pha-producing bacteria and the raw and distilled effluent from the anaerobic reactor as a substrate. a maximum accumulation of 17% of phb based on cell dry weight was achieved with a yield of 1.2 g phb/l when feeding with the distilled effluent. roche 454 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing of the pha-producing reactor showed that the microbial community was dominated by the pha-producing bacterial species paracoccus alcalophilus (32%) and azoarcus sp. (44%). our results show promising phb accumulation rates that outperform previously reported results obtained with real substrates and mixed cultures, demonstrating a sustainable approach for the production of pha less prone to contamination than a pure culture. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.","enhancement of pha production by a mixed microbial culture using vfa obtained from the fermentation of wastewater from yeast industry wastewater from the yeast production industry (wwy) is potentially harmful to surface water due to its high nitrogen and organic matter content; it can be used to produce compounds of higher commercial value, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (pha). pha are polyester-type biopolymers synthesized by bacteria as energy reservoirs that can potentially substitute petrochemical-derived plastics. in this exploratory work, effluent from wwy was used to produce pha, using a three-step setup of mixed microbial cultures involving one anaerobic and two aerobic reactors. first, volatile fatty acids (vfa; 2.5 g/l) were produced on an anaerobic batch reactor (reactor a) fed with wwy, using a heat pretreated sludge inoculum to eliminate methanogenic activity. concurrently, pha-producing bacteria were enriched using synthetic vfa in a sequencing batch reactor (sbr, reactor c) operated for 78 days. finally, a polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-producing reactor (reactor b) was assembled using the inoculum enriched with pha-producing bacteria and the raw and distilled effluent from the anaerobic reactor as a substrate. a maximum accumulation of 17% of phb based on cell dry weight was achieved with a yield of 1.2 g phb/l when feeding with the distilled effluent. roche 454 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing of the pha-producing reactor showed that the microbial community was dominated by the pha-producing bacterial species paracoccus alcalophilus (32%) and azoarcus sp.

2022,comparative preparation method and associated cost of lignin–cellulose nanocrystals,"lignin is a natural source of uv-shielding materials, though its recalcitrant and heterogeneous structure makes the extraction and purification processes complex. however, lignin’s functionality can be directly utilised when it stays as native with cellulose and hemicellulose in plant biomass, rather than being separated. the fabrication process of this native lignin is sustainable, as it consumes less energy and chemicals compared to purified lignin; thus, it is an economic and more straightforward approach. in this study, the properties of native and purified lignin–cellulose nanocrystals (l–cncs) sourced from hemp hurd waste were compared to explore the differences in their morphology, uv-shielding properties and chemical structure affected by their distinct fabrication process. these two kinds of l–cncs were further added into polyvinyl alcohol (pva) to evaluate their reinforcement characteristics. the resulting native l–cncs/pva film showed stronger uv-shielding ability than purified l–cncs. moreover, the native l–cncs showed better compati-bility with pva, while the purified l–cncs/pva interfaces showed phase separation. the phase separation in purified l–cncs/pva films reduced the films’ tensile strength and young’s modulus and increased the water vapour transmission. the laboratory-scale cost of native l–cncs production (~aud 80/kg) was only 10% of purified l–cncs (~aud 850/kg), resulting in a comparatively lower cost for preparing native l–cncs/pva composite films. overall, this study shows that the proposed method of production and use of native l–cncs can be an economic approach to deliver uv-shielding properties for potential applications, such as food packaging. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.","comparative preparation method and associated cost of lignin–cellulose nanocrystals lignin is a natural source of uv-shielding materials, though its recalcitrant and heterogeneous structure makes the extraction and purification processes complex. however, lignin’s functionality can be directly utilised when it stays as native with cellulose and hemicellulose in plant biomass, rather than being separated. the fabrication process of this native lignin is sustainable, as it consumes less energy and chemicals compared to purified lignin; thus, it is an economic and more straightforward approach. in this study, the properties of native and purified lignin–cellulose nanocrystals (l–cncs) sourced from hemp hurd waste were compared to explore the differences in their morphology, uv-shielding properties and chemical structure affected by their distinct fabrication process. these two kinds of l–cncs were further added into polyvinyl alcohol (pva) to evaluate their reinforcement characteristics. the resulting native l–cncs/pva film showed stronger uv-shielding ability than purified l–cncs. moreover, the native l–cncs showed better compati-bility with pva, while the purified l–cncs/pva interfaces showed phase separation. the phase separation in purified l–cncs/pva films reduced the films’ tensile strength and young’s modulus and increased the water vapour transmission. the laboratory-scale cost of native l–cncs production (~aud 80/kg) was only 10% of purified l–cncs (~aud 850/kg), resulting in a comparatively lower cost for preparing native l–cncs/pva composite films. overall, this study shows that the proposed method of production and use of native l–cncs can be an economic approach to deliver uv-shielding properties for potential applications, such as food packaging. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",1,water,0.8322508335113525
2022,marble dust effect on the air quality: an environmental assessment approach,"all over the world, increasing anthropogenic activities, industrialization, and urbanization have intensified the emissions of various pollutants that cause air pollution. marble quarries in pakistan are abundant and there is a plethora of small-and large-scale industries, including mining and marble-based industries. the air pollution caused by the dust generated in the process of crushing and extracting marble can cause serious problems to the general physiological functions of plants and it affects human life as well. therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the air quality of areas with marble factories and areas without marble factories, where the concentration of particulate matter in terms of total suspended particles (tsp) was determined. for this purpose, epam-5000 equipment was used to measure the particulate levels. besides this, a spectrophotome-ter was used to analyze the presence of pm2.5 and pm10 in the chemical composition of marble dust. it was observed that the tsp concentrations in darmangi and malagori areas of peshawar, pakistan—having marble factories—were 626 µg/m3 and 5321 µg/m3 respectively. the (pm2.5, pm10) concentration in darmangi was (189 µg/m3, 520 µg/m3) and in malagori, it was recorded as (195 µg/m3, 631 µg/m3), which was significantly higher than the non-marble dust areas and also exceeded who recommended standards. it was concluded that the areas with the marble factories were more susceptible to air pollution as the concentration of tsp was significantly higher than the recommended tsp levels. it is recommended that marble factories should be shifted away from residential areas along with strict enforcement. people should be instructed to use protective equipment and waste management should be ensured along with control mechanisms to monitor particulate levels. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.","marble dust effect on the air quality: an environmental assessment approach all over the world, increasing anthropogenic activities, industrialization, and urbanization have intensified the emissions of various pollutants that cause air pollution. marble quarries in pakistan are abundant and there is a plethora of small-and large-scale industries, including mining and marble-based industries. the air pollution caused by the dust generated in the process of crushing and extracting marble can cause serious problems to the general physiological functions of plants and it affects human life as well. therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the air quality of areas with marble factories and areas without marble factories, where the concentration of particulate matter in terms of total suspended particles (tsp) was determined. for this purpose, epam-5000 equipment was used to measure the particulate levels. besides this, a spectrophotome-ter was used to analyze the presence of pm2.5 and pm10 in the chemical composition of marble dust. it was observed that the tsp concentrations in darmangi and malagori areas of peshawar, pakistan—having marble factories—were 626 µg/m3 and 5321 µg/m3 respectively. the (pm2.5, pm10) concentration in darmangi was (189 µg/m3, 520 µg/m3) and in malagori, it was recorded as (195 µg/m3, 631 µg/m3), which was significantly higher than the non-marble dust areas and also exceeded who recommended standards. it was concluded that the areas with the marble factories were more susceptible to air pollution as the concentration of tsp was significantly higher than the recommended tsp levels. it is recommended that marble factories should be shifted away from residential areas along with strict enforcement. people should be instructed to use protective equipment and waste management should be ensured along with control mechanisms to monitor particulate levels. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",2,air,0.9422423243522644

2022,fate of pharmaceuticals and pfass during the electrochemical generation of a nitrogen-rich nutrient product from real reject water,"recycling vital macronutrients, such as nitrogen, from wastewaters back to fertiliser use is becoming essential to ensure sustainable agricultural practices. technologies developed for such purposes are typically evaluated for their capacity to recover nutrients; however, the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (cecs) in these waste-derived nutrient products must not be overlooked. in this study, nitrogen was recovered from real anaerobically digested municipal sewage sludge reject water using a novel set-up combining membrane-based electroconcentration (ec) with electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (eaops). simultaneously, the fate of five spiked pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, erythromycin and metoprolol) as well as ten indigenous perfluoroalkyl substances (pfass) was investigated. the ec-eaop system was effective in up-concentrating nitrogen ca. 13 times to a final concentration of 12.7 ± 0.8 g l−1 in the nutrient product. at the same time, no up-concentration was observed for the pharmaceuticals and their concentrations in the recovered concentrated remained at ≤ 3.4 ± 1.3 µg l−1. the eaops were the main transformation mechanism for all the pharmaceuticals at 33–88% efficiency, while diclofenac also notably adsorbed in the system (30 ± 1.4%). out of the ten studied pfass, only three were found in the recovered nutrient concentrate, albeit at very limited concentrations of ≤ 0.024 ± 0.013 µg l−1. the eaops were found to degrade longer-chain pfass into their shorter-chain counterparts. the low contaminant concentrations in the nutrient product pose a reduced risk for soil contamination compared to, e.g., biosolids that are more typically used as fertilisers. © 2022","fate of pharmaceuticals and pfass during the electrochemical generation of a nitrogen-rich nutrient product from real reject water recycling vital macronutrients, such as nitrogen, from wastewaters back to fertiliser use is becoming essential to ensure sustainable agricultural practices. technologies developed for such purposes are typically evaluated for their capacity to recover nutrients; however, the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (cecs) in these waste-derived nutrient products must not be overlooked. in this study, nitrogen was recovered from real anaerobically digested municipal sewage sludge reject water using a novel set-up combining membrane-based electroconcentration (ec) with electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (eaops). simultaneously, the fate of five spiked pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, erythromycin and metoprolol) as well as ten indigenous perfluoroalkyl substances (pfass) was investigated. the ec-eaop system was effective in up-concentrating nitrogen ca. 13 times to a final concentration of 12.7 ± 0.8 g l−1 in the nutrient product. at the same time, no up-concentration was observed for the pharmaceuticals and their concentrations in the recovered concentrated remained at ≤ 3.4 ± 1.3 µg l−1. the eaops were the main transformation mechanism for all the pharmaceuticals at 33–88% efficiency, while diclofenac also notably adsorbed in the system (30 ± 1.4%). out of the ten studied pfass, only three were found in the recovered nutrient concentrate, albeit at very limited concentrations of ≤ 0.024 ± 0.013 µg l−1. the eaops were found to degrade longer-chain pfass into their shorter-chain counterparts. the low contaminant concentrations in the nutrient product pose a reduced risk for soil contamination compared to, e.g., biosolids that are more typically used as fertilisers. © 2022",0,soil,0.971659779548645
2022,role of sustainable heat sources in transition towards fourth generation district heating – a review,"as an integrated part of future sustainable energy systems, district heating has been widely established as a convenient solution to provide energy-efficient space heating and sanitary hot water. in the pathway towards decarbonization of district heating, its 4th generation enables integration of high shares of renewable energy sources and waste heat. this article reviews the challenges confronted by such integration, investigating the technical and non-technical difficulties associated with the exploitation of solar thermal, waste heat, geothermal, and biomass energy sources into district heating systems. the study reveals that although solar thermal district heating is a mature technology, optimization of solar field size, location and collector type is still an active research field. in application of waste heat, distance between heat sources and users is often a barrier. moreover, low-temperature waste heat and low-enthalpy geothermal sources require application of heat pumps. as regards biomass, its theoretical dispatchability is in practice limited by logistical challenges and low flexibility of biomass boilers, mostly relegating it to cover base load only. thus, biomass does not appear to be a long-term solution for heating purposes, also considering its competing use to produce biofuels (needed for sectors more difficult to decarbonize). lastly, application of seasonal storage coupled with heat pumps is expected to play a crucial role in maximizing renewable energy use, but its sizing and integration requires dynamic analysis of heat demand as well as of charging and discharging temperatures. © 2022 elsevier ltd","role of sustainable heat sources in transition towards fourth generation district heating – a review as an integrated part of future sustainable energy systems, district heating has been widely established as a convenient solution to provide energy-efficient space heating and sanitary hot water. in the pathway towards decarbonization of district heating, its 4th generation enables integration of high shares of renewable energy sources and waste heat. this article reviews the challenges confronted by such integration, investigating the technical and non-technical difficulties associated with the exploitation of solar thermal, waste heat, geothermal, and biomass energy sources into district heating systems. the study reveals that although solar thermal district heating is a mature technology, optimization of solar field size, location and collector type is still an active research field. in application of waste heat, distance between heat sources and users is often a barrier. moreover, low-temperature waste heat and low-enthalpy geothermal sources require application of heat pumps. as regards biomass, its theoretical dispatchability is in practice limited by logistical challenges and low flexibility of biomass boilers, mostly relegating it to cover base load only. thus, biomass does not appear to be a long-term solution for heating purposes, also considering its competing use to produce biofuels (needed for sectors more difficult to decarbonize). lastly, application of seasonal storage coupled with heat pumps is expected to play a crucial role in maximizing renewable energy use, but its sizing and integration requires dynamic analysis of heat demand as well as of charging and discharging temperatures. © 2022 elsevier ltd",1,water,0.9505186080932617

2022,machine learning-based compressive strength modelling of concrete incorporating waste marble powder,"in recent years, the volume of waste marble powder (wmp) from ornamental stone factories has increased rapidly, causing environmental concerns of soil, water and air pollution. while some studies have explored the benefits of incorporating wmp in concrete mixtures, the lack of pertinent data and a comprehensive understanding of how wmp influences the engineering properties of concrete has hindered the large-scale applications of wmp in the concrete industry. therefore, this study examines the capability of machine learning (ml) to model the compressive strength (cs) of concrete incorporating wmp since it is the most specified property of concrete. wmp can improve the performance of concrete mainly owing to a physical microfiller effect and providing preferential sites for the nucleation and growth of early-age cement hydration products. however, considering that the pozzolanic reactivity of wmp is insignificant as demonstrated by phase composition and thermogravimetric results, its incorporation rate in concrete mixtures should be limited to a specific dosage, which can be optimized using ml techniques. ml modelling results showed that the cs of wmp concrete could be predicted with high accuracy (r2 &gt; 0.97) using extreme gradient boosting (xgb) and artificial neural networks (ann) informational models, with ann being more sensitive to the content of wmp. the feature importance results, with multicollinearity consideration, showed that the role of wmp in strength development could be mainly limited to 10–20% due to its inert nature. © 2022 elsevier ltd","machine learning-based compressive strength modelling of concrete incorporating waste marble powder in recent years, the volume of waste marble powder (wmp) from ornamental stone factories has increased rapidly, causing environmental concerns of soil, water and air pollution. while some studies have explored the benefits of incorporating wmp in concrete mixtures, the lack of pertinent data and a comprehensive understanding of how wmp influences the engineering properties of concrete has hindered the large-scale applications of wmp in the concrete industry. therefore, this study examines the capability of machine learning (ml) to model the compressive strength (cs) of concrete incorporating wmp since it is the most specified property of concrete. wmp can improve the performance of concrete mainly owing to a physical microfiller effect and providing preferential sites for the nucleation and growth of early-age cement hydration products. however, considering that the pozzolanic reactivity of wmp is insignificant as demonstrated by phase composition and thermogravimetric results, its incorporation rate in concrete mixtures should be limited to a specific dosage, which can be optimized using ml techniques. ml modelling results showed that the cs of wmp concrete could be predicted with high accuracy (r2 &gt; 0.97) using extreme gradient boosting (xgb) and artificial neural networks (ann) informational models, with ann being more sensitive to the content of wmp. the feature importance results, with multicollinearity consideration, showed that the role of wmp in strength development could be mainly limited to 10–20% due to its inert nature. © 2022 elsevier ltd",0,soil,0.8424127697944641

2022,co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and food waste digestate to synergistically improve biochar characteristics and heavy metals immobilization,"food waste digestate (fwd) is a desirable additive in sewage sludge (ss)-based biochar preparation owing to its high contents of intrinsic inorganic minerals and lignocellulosic compounds. in this study, we investigated the co-pyrolysis of ss with fwd at different mixing ratios (4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 0:4; ss:fwd w/w) at 550 °c to synergistically improve the biochar characteristics and immobilize the heavy metals in the ss. the results showed that co-pyrolysis of ss with fwd greatly increased the aromaticity and ph (by 13.22–26.56%) of the blended biochar, and significantly reduced the contents of total and bioavailable heavy metals. the addition of fwd effectively enhanced the conversion of heavy metals from less stable fractions to more stable forms, but led to the transformation of cr from the residual fraction (f4) to the oxidizable fraction (f3) when the fwd:ss ratio was ≥ 3:1. overall, the formation of co-crystal compounds, stable kaolinite, and metal oxides together with the enhancement of biochar characteristics during co-pyrolysis significantly reduced the heavy metal-associated ecological risk (potential ecological risk index lower than 15.51) and phytotoxicity (germination index higher than 139.41%) of the blended biochar. these findings suggest that high levels of mineral components in fwd greatly immobilize more heavy metals in biochar. © 2022","co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and food waste digestate to synergistically improve biochar characteristics and heavy metals immobilization food waste digestate (fwd) is a desirable additive in sewage sludge (ss)-based biochar preparation owing to its high contents of intrinsic inorganic minerals and lignocellulosic compounds. in this study, we investigated the co-pyrolysis of ss with fwd at different mixing ratios (4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 0:4; ss:fwd w/w) at 550 °c to synergistically improve the biochar characteristics and immobilize the heavy metals in the ss. the results showed that co-pyrolysis of ss with fwd greatly increased the aromaticity and ph (by 13.22–26.56%) of the blended biochar, and significantly reduced the contents of total and bioavailable heavy metals. the addition of fwd effectively enhanced the conversion of heavy metals from less stable fractions to more stable forms, but led to the transformation of cr from the residual fraction (f4) to the oxidizable fraction (f3) when the fwd:ss ratio was ≥ 3:1. overall, the formation of co-crystal compounds, stable kaolinite, and metal oxides together with the enhancement of biochar characteristics during co-pyrolysis significantly reduced the heavy metal-associated ecological risk (potential ecological risk index lower than 15.51) and phytotoxicity (germination index higher than 139.41%) of the blended biochar. these findings suggest that high levels of mineral components in fwd greatly immobilize more heavy metals in biochar. © 2022",3,metal,0.9217588305473328

2022,characterising microplastics in shower wastewater with raman imaging,"microplastics can potentially be released in our daily activities, such as via our showers, as our clothes are made of plastic fibres, and/or cotton fibres. the challenge is how to characterise these microplastics in shower debris. herewith we employ raman imaging to directly visualise the microplastics collected from shower wastewater. raman can map an image from the scanning array that contains a matrix of thousands of spectra, featuring a considerably higher signal-noise ratio than that from a single spectrum. the increased signal-noise ratio reduces the complexity of sample preparation. consequently, after the shower debris was sampled and washed, raman imaging allowed us to distinguish the microplastic fibres from the background including cotton fibres and dirt aggregates. interestingly, by adjusting the laser power intensity, the scanning process enabled simultaneous in-situ bleaching of the colorants formulated in the textile fibres and collection of signals. the disadvantage of raman imaging such as the short focusing/working distance is also presented and discussed. overall, the raman imaging can extract meaningful information from the complex shower debris samples to enable analysis of microplastics. © 2021 elsevier b.v.","characterising microplastics in shower wastewater with raman imaging microplastics can potentially be released in our daily activities, such as via our showers, as our clothes are made of plastic fibres, and/or cotton fibres. the challenge is how to characterise these microplastics in shower debris. herewith we employ raman imaging to directly visualise the microplastics collected from shower wastewater. raman can map an image from the scanning array that contains a matrix of thousands of spectra, featuring a considerably higher signal-noise ratio than that from a single spectrum. the increased signal-noise ratio reduces the complexity of sample preparation. consequently, after the shower debris was sampled and washed, raman imaging allowed us to distinguish the microplastic fibres from the background including cotton fibres and dirt aggregates. interestingly, by adjusting the laser power intensity, the scanning process enabled simultaneous in-situ bleaching of the colorants formulated in the textile fibres and collection of signals. the disadvantage of raman imaging such as the short focusing/working distance is also presented and discussed. overall, the raman imaging can extract meaningful information from the complex shower debris samples to enable analysis of microplastics. © 2021 elsevier b.v.",1,water,0.8504589200019836
2022,unravelling in-situ hardpan properties and functions in capping sulfidic cu-pb-zn tailings and forming a duplex soil system cover,"developing alternative approaches to cap and rehabilitate the large areas of tailings landscapes is critical for sustainable development of mining industry. this study revealed the potential of an in-situ hardpan-based duplex soil system as an un-conventional approach to rehabilitate sulfidic cu-pb-zn tailings. under a shallow silicious soil cover, a massive and consistent hardpan horizon had been formed in-situ at the surface layer of tailings across the trial area, which physically separated root zones (i.e., silica soil cover) from the un-weathered tailings underneath, prevented capillary enrichment of acidity and soluble solutes into the root zones, and sustained native plant growth for more than a decade. precipitation of si-rich ferric complexes were attributed to the stabilisation/solidification of the sulfidic tailing. the hardpan layer possesses a highly compacted texture, a low-percolating pore network, and extreme resistance to water movement in the hardpan horizon. further, the hardpans directly interfacing with plant roots in the soil cover were geochemically stabilised and attenuated, with very low levels of soluble metal(loid)s and a circumneutral ph condition. this case study would serve as a good incentive to develop bio-chemical engineering methodology building on current knowledge for achieving sustainable rehabilitation of sulfidic and metallic tailings in future. © 2021 elsevier b.v.","unravelling in-situ hardpan properties and functions in capping sulfidic cu-pb-zn tailings and forming a duplex soil system cover developing alternative approaches to cap and rehabilitate the large areas of tailings landscapes is critical for sustainable development of mining industry. this study revealed the potential of an in-situ hardpan-based duplex soil system as an un-conventional approach to rehabilitate sulfidic cu-pb-zn tailings. under a shallow silicious soil cover, a massive and consistent hardpan horizon had been formed in-situ at the surface layer of tailings across the trial area, which physically separated root zones (i.e., silica soil cover) from the un-weathered tailings underneath, prevented capillary enrichment of acidity and soluble solutes into the root zones, and sustained native plant growth for more than a decade. precipitation of si-rich ferric complexes were attributed to the stabilisation/solidification of the sulfidic tailing. the hardpan layer possesses a highly compacted texture, a low-percolating pore network, and extreme resistance to water movement in the hardpan horizon. further, the hardpans directly interfacing with plant roots in the soil cover were geochemically stabilised and attenuated, with very low levels of soluble metal(loid)s and a circumneutral ph condition. this case study would serve as a good incentive to develop bio-chemical engineering methodology building on current knowledge for achieving sustainable rehabilitation of sulfidic and metallic tailings in future. © 2021 elsevier b.v.",0,soil,0.9617851972579956
2022,combined utilization of construction and demolition waste and propylene fiber in cement-stabilized soil,"construction and demolition (c&d) waste has become a research hotspot due to the need for environmental sustainability and strength enhancement of cementitious materials. however, wider applications of c&d waste are limited, as its non-homogeneous surface nature limits its workability. this research evaluated the feasible utilization of c&d waste as aggregates in polypropylene-fiber-reinforced cement-stabilized soil (css) under sulfate-alkali activation. css specimens incorporated portland cement and c&d waste in 10%, 20%, and 30% proportions. also, polypropylene fiber after alkali activation by sodium sulfate (at 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8% dosing level) was defined as 1%, 2%, and 4%. strength enhancement was examined through unconfined compressive strength (ucs) and flexural strength tests at 7, 14 and 28 days. test results indicated that mechanical properties showed significant improvement with increasing levels of portland cement and sodium sulfate, while the improvement dropped after excessive addition of c&d waste and polypropylene fiber. optimal proportioning was determined as 30%, 4%, 20%, and 0.8% for portland cement, polypropylene fiber, c&d waste, and sodium sulfate, respectively. scanning electron microscope (sem) analysis attributed the enhancement to hydration product (ettringite) formation, bridging effect and increased particle friction. additionally, the decrease in amplification was ascribed to the destruction of interface transition-zone (itz) strength, resulting in premature failure. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.","combined utilization of construction and demolition waste and propylene fiber in cement-stabilized soil construction and demolition (c&d) waste has become a research hotspot due to the need for environmental sustainability and strength enhancement of cementitious materials. however, wider applications of c&d waste are limited, as its non-homogeneous surface nature limits its workability. this research evaluated the feasible utilization of c&d waste as aggregates in polypropylene-fiber-reinforced cement-stabilized soil (css) under sulfate-alkali activation. css specimens incorporated portland cement and c&d waste in 10%, 20%, and 30% proportions. also, polypropylene fiber after alkali activation by sodium sulfate (at 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8% dosing level) was defined as 1%, 2%, and 4%. strength enhancement was examined through unconfined compressive strength (ucs) and flexural strength tests at 7, 14 and 28 days. test results indicated that mechanical properties showed significant improvement with increasing levels of portland cement and sodium sulfate, while the improvement dropped after excessive addition of c&d waste and polypropylene fiber. optimal proportioning was determined as 30%, 4%, 20%, and 0.8% for portland cement, polypropylene fiber, c&d waste, and sodium sulfate, respectively. scanning electron microscope (sem) analysis attributed the enhancement to hydration product (ettringite) formation, bridging effect and increased particle friction. additionally, the decrease in amplification was ascribed to the destruction of interface transition-zone (itz) strength, resulting in premature failure. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",0,soil,0.9951375126838684
2022,sustainable shotcrete production with waste glass aggregates,"this study employs statistical and experimental procedures to assess the applicability of crushed waste glass to replace natural sand in shotcrete production for use in tunneling, mining and excavation industries as a support system. mechanical strength under different uniaxial and biaxial load combinations, fracture properties, and ultra-high-speed photography of the crack growth mode in the newly developed shotcrete mixes were studied and compared against the control mix at 0% waste glass inclusion. results suggest that shotcrete mixes containing synthetic glass aggregates exhibit similar or higher strength properties (compared with conventional shotcrete with natural aggregates) at early and late ages in both fresh and hardened shotcrete samples. under biaxial stress conditions, in particular, the new glass shotcrete designs demonstrate a higher load-bearing capacity of up to 35% increase. compared to conventional shotcrete, replacing sand with recycled glass aggregates further exhibited the need for less water and binder consumption owing to the glass water-reducing effect. this in return could leave more water available for improved workability in the mixture hence producing a more cost-effective and eco-friendly shotcrete product. from the results, no impairment of performance was recorded by substituting sand with crushed waste glass even at a high substitution percentage of up to 100%; suggesting high improvement potential of crushed waste glass re-use in the shotcrete industry. © 2022, the author(s).","sustainable shotcrete production with waste glass aggregates this study employs statistical and experimental procedures to assess the applicability of crushed waste glass to replace natural sand in shotcrete production for use in tunneling, mining and excavation industries as a support system. mechanical strength under different uniaxial and biaxial load combinations, fracture properties, and ultra-high-speed photography of the crack growth mode in the newly developed shotcrete mixes were studied and compared against the control mix at 0% waste glass inclusion. results suggest that shotcrete mixes containing synthetic glass aggregates exhibit similar or higher strength properties (compared with conventional shotcrete with natural aggregates) at early and late ages in both fresh and hardened shotcrete samples. under biaxial stress conditions, in particular, the new glass shotcrete designs demonstrate a higher load-bearing capacity of up to 35% increase. compared to conventional shotcrete, replacing sand with recycled glass aggregates further exhibited the need for less water and binder consumption owing to the glass water-reducing effect. this in return could leave more water available for improved workability in the mixture hence producing a more cost-effective and eco-friendly shotcrete product. from the results, no impairment of performance was recorded by substituting sand with crushed waste glass even at a high substitution percentage of up to 100%; suggesting high improvement potential of crushed waste glass re-use in the shotcrete industry. © 2022, the author(s).",1,water,0.8879519104957581

2022,global soil organic carbon changes and economic revenues with biochar application,"biochar has been proposed as a promising negative co2 emission technology to mitigate future climate change with the additional benefit of increasing agricultural production. however, the spatial responses of soil organic carbon (soc) to biochar addition in cropland are still uncertain, and the economic feasibility of large-scale biochar implementation remains unclear. here, we analyzed the response of soc to biochar addition using 389 paired field measurements. the results show that biochar addition significantly increased soc by 45.8% on average with large regional variations. using a random forest model trained with soil, climate, biotic, biochar, and management factors, we found that the response of soc to biochar addition was mainly dependent on biochar application rates, initial soc, edaphic (e.g., ph), and climatic (e.g., mean annual precipitation) variables. combined with the predicted soc changes to biochar addition on the global cropland, we assessed the revenue of the biochar system based on the current and potential pyrolysis plants in the world using the life-cycle analysis. net revenue of the currently existing 144 pyrolysis plants increases with larger plant capacity and higher carbon price. potential revenue of building new plants is high in regions like america and europe but low in regions with infertile soil, low crop residues availability, and inconvenient transportation. the global co2 removal of biochar application is 6.6 tg co2e (co2 equivalent) year−1 with a net revenue of $ 177 million dollars at a carbon price of $ 50 t−1 co2 for current pyrolysis plants with a biomass-processing capacity of 20,000 t year−1. our study provides a full economic assessment of idealized biochar addition scenarios and identifies the locations with maximal potential revenues with new pyrolysis plants. © 2021 the authors. gcb bioenergy published by john wiley & sons ltd.","global soil organic carbon changes and economic revenues with biochar application biochar has been proposed as a promising negative co2 emission technology to mitigate future climate change with the additional benefit of increasing agricultural production. however, the spatial responses of soil organic carbon (soc) to biochar addition in cropland are still uncertain, and the economic feasibility of large-scale biochar implementation remains unclear. here, we analyzed the response of soc to biochar addition using 389 paired field measurements. the results show that biochar addition significantly increased soc by 45.8% on average with large regional variations. using a random forest model trained with soil, climate, biotic, biochar, and management factors, we found that the response of soc to biochar addition was mainly dependent on biochar application rates, initial soc, edaphic (e.g., ph), and climatic (e.g., mean annual precipitation) variables. combined with the predicted soc changes to biochar addition on the global cropland, we assessed the revenue of the biochar system based on the current and potential pyrolysis plants in the world using the life-cycle analysis. net revenue of the currently existing 144 pyrolysis plants increases with larger plant capacity and higher carbon price. potential revenue of building new plants is high in regions like america and europe but low in regions with infertile soil, low crop residues availability, and inconvenient transportation. the global co2 removal of biochar application is 6.6 tg co2e (co2 equivalent) year−1 with a net revenue of $ 177 million dollars at a carbon price of $ 50 t−1 co2 for current pyrolysis plants with a biomass-processing capacity of 20,000 t year−1. our study provides a full economic assessment of idealized biochar addition scenarios and identifies the locations with maximal potential revenues with new pyrolysis plants. © 2021 the authors. gcb bioenergy published by john wiley & sons ltd.",0,soil,0.9915575981140137

2022,addition of iron to agricultural topsoil and subsoil is not an effective c sequestration strategy,"the interaction of soil organic matter (som) with fe-containing minerals represents a key mechanism that promotes carbon (c) stabilisation in soil. the addition of fe-rich industrial by-products to soil may therefore help accelerate c storage. our understanding of the effects of exogenous fe addition (fe (oxy)hydroxide vs. fe chloride) on som dynamics and c dynamics in agricultural soils, especially in subsoils, however, remains poor. here, we simulate the addition of fe in an arable soil context and assess its effectiveness based on co2 emissions and soil chemistry. we hypothesised that insoluble and soluble fe would reduce the mineralization of newly added unprotected organic materials more than native som and that soluble fe would cause mineralisation of native som. to investigate this, insoluble fe(oh)3 or soluble fecl2 (0–5 g kg−1) were added to arable top- (0–10 cm) or subsoils (50–60 cm) and co2 emissions, ph and nutrient dynamics (e.g. p, n) measured in a laboratory incubation over a 45 d period. we also compared the effect of fe on the turnover of native som and newly added c (i.e. 14c-labelled glucose, citrate and crop residues) which was pre-mixed with exogenous fe. we found that: (1) despite a reduction in p and doc, fe(oh)3 did not suppress total co2 efflux; (2) high fecl2 rates induced a rapid and significant release of co2, which we attribute almost entirely to fecl2-induced soil acidification increasing doc availability and carbonate dissolution; (3) 14c-substrate mineralisation was weakly suppressed by fe(oh)3 but strongly by fecl2 following the series: citrate &lt; glucose &lt; crop residues; and (4) fe addition to subsoils induced a stronger c mineralisation response but weaker effect on soil solution chemistry compared to topsoil, possibly due to subsoils having a lower buffering ability and less microbial biomass. we conclude that addition of extra fe was not effective in promoting greater c sequestration in the arable soil we tested. © 2021 elsevier b.v.","addition of iron to agricultural topsoil and subsoil is not an effective c sequestration strategy the interaction of soil organic matter (som) with fe-containing minerals represents a key mechanism that promotes carbon (c) stabilisation in soil. the addition of fe-rich industrial by-products to soil may therefore help accelerate c storage. our understanding of the effects of exogenous fe addition (fe (oxy)hydroxide vs. fe chloride) on som dynamics and c dynamics in agricultural soils, especially in subsoils, however, remains poor. here, we simulate the addition of fe in an arable soil context and assess its effectiveness based on co2 emissions and soil chemistry. we hypothesised that insoluble and soluble fe would reduce the mineralization of newly added unprotected organic materials more than native som and that soluble fe would cause mineralisation of native som. to investigate this, insoluble fe(oh)3 or soluble fecl2 (0–5 g kg−1) were added to arable top- (0–10 cm) or subsoils (50–60 cm) and co2 emissions, ph and nutrient dynamics (e.g. p, n) measured in a laboratory incubation over a 45 d period. we also compared the effect of fe on the turnover of native som and newly added c (i.e. 14c-labelled glucose, citrate and crop residues) which was pre-mixed with exogenous fe. we found that: (1) despite a reduction in p and doc, fe(oh)3 did not suppress total co2 efflux; (2) high fecl2 rates induced a rapid and significant release of co2, which we attribute almost entirely to fecl2-induced soil acidification increasing doc availability and carbonate dissolution; (3) 14c-substrate mineralisation was weakly suppressed by fe(oh)3 but strongly by fecl2 following the series: citrate &lt; glucose &lt; crop residues; and (4) fe addition to subsoils induced a stronger c mineralisation response but weaker effect on soil solution chemistry compared to topsoil, possibly due to subsoils having a lower buffering ability and less microbial biomass. we conclude that addition of extra fe was not effective in promoting greater c sequestration in the arable soil we tested. © 2021 elsevier b.v.",0,soil,0.9653487205505371

2022,a remediation approach to chromium-contaminated water and soil using engineered biochar derived from peanut shell,"hexavalent chromium (cr[vi]) is one of the major environmental concerns due to its excessive discharge through effluents from the leather tanning industry. peanut production leads to the generation of residual shells as waste calling for sustainable disposal. in this study, we employed an innovative approach of applying peanut-shell-derived pristine and engineered biochar for the remediation of cr-contaminated wastewater and soil. the peanut shell waste was converted to biochar, which was further engineered with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab, a commonly used cationic surfactant). the biochars were then used for the adsorption and immobilization of cr(vi) in water and soil, respectively. the adsorption experiments demonstrated high cr(vi) removal efficiency for the engineered biochar (79.35%) compared with the pristine biochar (37.47%). the langmuir model best described the cr(vi) adsorption onto the biochars (r2 &gt; 0.97), indicating monolayer adsorption. meanwhile, the adsorption kinetics indicated that chemisorption was the dominant mechanism of interaction between the cr(vi) and the biochars, as indicated by the best fitting to the pseudo-second-order model (r2 &gt; 0.98). adsorption through the fixed-bed column also presented higher cr(vi) adsorption onto the engineered biochar (qeq = 22.93 mg g−1) than onto the pristine biochar (qeq = 18.54 mg g−1). in addition, the desorption rate was higher for the pristine biochar column (13.83 mg g−1) than the engineered biochar column (10.45 mg g−1), indicating that cr(vi) was more strongly adsorbed onto the engineered biochar. a higher immobilization of cr(vi) was observed in the soil with the engineered biochar than with the pristine biochar, as was confirmed by the significant decreases in the cr(vi) bioavailability (92%), leachability (100%), and bioaccessibility (97%) compared with the control (soil without biochar). the ctab-engineered biochar could thus potentially be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal and the immobilization of cr(vi) in water and soil, respectively. © 2021","a remediation approach to chromium-contaminated water and soil using engineered biochar derived from peanut shell hexavalent chromium (cr[vi]) is one of the major environmental concerns due to its excessive discharge through effluents from the leather tanning industry. peanut production leads to the generation of residual shells as waste calling for sustainable disposal. in this study, we employed an innovative approach of applying peanut-shell-derived pristine and engineered biochar for the remediation of cr-contaminated wastewater and soil. the peanut shell waste was converted to biochar, which was further engineered with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ctab, a commonly used cationic surfactant). the biochars were then used for the adsorption and immobilization of cr(vi) in water and soil, respectively. the adsorption experiments demonstrated high cr(vi) removal efficiency for the engineered biochar (79.35%) compared with the pristine biochar (37.47%). the langmuir model best described the cr(vi) adsorption onto the biochars (r2 &gt; 0.97), indicating monolayer adsorption. meanwhile, the adsorption kinetics indicated that chemisorption was the dominant mechanism of interaction between the cr(vi) and the biochars, as indicated by the best fitting to the pseudo-second-order model (r2 &gt; 0.98). adsorption through the fixed-bed column also presented higher cr(vi) adsorption onto the engineered biochar (qeq = 22.93 mg g−1) than onto the pristine biochar (qeq = 18.54 mg g−1). in addition, the desorption rate was higher for the pristine biochar column (13.83 mg g−1) than the engineered biochar column (10.45 mg g−1), indicating that cr(vi) was more strongly adsorbed onto the engineered biochar. a higher immobilization of cr(vi) was observed in the soil with the engineered biochar than with the pristine biochar, as was confirmed by the significant decreases in the cr(vi) bioavailability (92%), leachability (100%), and bioaccessibility (97%) compared with the control (soil without biochar). the ctab-engineered biochar could thus potentially be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal and the immobilization of cr(vi) in water and soil, respectively. © 2021",0,soil,0.8924904465675354
2022,value of dehydrated food waste fertiliser products in increasing soil health and crop productivity,"dehydration of food waste is a technique in which food waste is dewatered to form a low moisture product. this research characterised the physicochemical properties of different dehydrated food waste products and examined their value in improving physical, biological, and chemical properties of soils. dehydrated food waste products were slightly acidic (4.7–5.1) with high levels of electrical conductivity (ec) (4.83–7.64 ms cm−1). the products were composed of complex carbohydrates, polysaccharides, alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acid, lipids, and fats and contained high levels of total and available nutrients. dehydrated food wastes slightly impacted the soil ph; however, they significantly increased soil ec, which may cause soil salinity when applied repeatedly. the food waste products also increased macro-nutrients (n, p, and k) for plants across different soil types. carbon and nutrients in dehydrated food waste increased microbial activity, measured by basal respiration. delayed germination and reduced plant growth of corn (zea mays) and wheat (triticum aestivum) plants were observed at high application rates of dehydrated food waste. this may have resulted from a combination of phytotoxins, anoxic conditions, salinity as well as the water-repellent nature of dehydrated food waste. however, release of nutrients increased nutrient uptake and plant biomass in corn and wheat plants at low levels of food waste application. the dehydrated food waste products may require composting prior to soil application or incorporation into soil for a long duration prior to planting. these processes will overcome the limitations of phytotoxins, anoxic conditions, salinity, and water repellence. further work is required to optimise the levels of dehydrated food waste application to improve soil health and crop productivity. © 2021","value of dehydrated food waste fertiliser products in increasing soil health and crop productivity dehydration of food waste is a technique in which food waste is dewatered to form a low moisture product. this research characterised the physicochemical properties of different dehydrated food waste products and examined their value in improving physical, biological, and chemical properties of soils. dehydrated food waste products were slightly acidic (4.7–5.1) with high levels of electrical conductivity (ec) (4.83–7.64 ms cm−1). the products were composed of complex carbohydrates, polysaccharides, alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acid, lipids, and fats and contained high levels of total and available nutrients. dehydrated food wastes slightly impacted the soil ph; however, they significantly increased soil ec, which may cause soil salinity when applied repeatedly. the food waste products also increased macro-nutrients (n, p, and k) for plants across different soil types. carbon and nutrients in dehydrated food waste increased microbial activity, measured by basal respiration. delayed germination and reduced plant growth of corn (zea mays) and wheat (triticum aestivum) plants were observed at high application rates of dehydrated food waste. this may have resulted from a combination of phytotoxins, anoxic conditions, salinity as well as the water-repellent nature of dehydrated food waste. however, release of nutrients increased nutrient uptake and plant biomass in corn and wheat plants at low levels of food waste application. the dehydrated food waste products may require composting prior to soil application or incorporation into soil for a long duration prior to planting. these processes will overcome the limitations of phytotoxins, anoxic conditions, salinity, and water repellence. further work is required to optimise the levels of dehydrated food waste application to improve soil health and crop productivity. © 2021",0,soil,0.9856245517730713

2022,controlling the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by engineering biofilm physical structure,"the application of membrane technology for water treatment and reuse is hampered by the development of a microbial biofilm. biofilm growth in micro-and ultrafiltration (mf/uf) membrane modules, on both the membrane surface and feed spacer, can form a secondary membrane and exert resistance to permeation and crossflow, increasing energy demand and decreasing permeate quantity and quality. in recent years, exhaustive efforts were made to understand the chemical, structural and hydraulic characteristics of membrane biofilms. in this review, we critically assess which specific structural features of membrane biofilms exert resistance to forced water passage in mf/uf membranes systems applied to water and wastewater treatment, and how biofilm physical structure can be engineered by process operation to impose less hydraulic resistance (“below-the-pain threshold”). counter-intuitively, biofilms with greater thickness do not always cause a higher hydraulic resistance than thinner biofilms. dense biofilms, however, had consistently higher hydraulic resistances compared to less dense biofilms. the mechanism by which density exerts hydraulic resistance is reported in the literature to be dependant on the biofilms’ internal packing structure and eps chemical composition (e.g., porosity, polymer concentration). current reports of internal porosity in membrane biofilms are not supported by adequate experimental evidence or by a reliable methodology, limiting a unified understanding of biofilm internal structure. identifying the dependency of hydraulic resistance on biofilm density invites efforts to control the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by engineering internal biofilm structure. regulation of biofilm internal structure is possible by alteration of key determinants such as feed water nutrient composition/concentration, hydraulic shear stress and resistance and can engineer biofilm structural development to decrease density and therein hydraulic resistance. future efforts should seek to determine the extent to which the concept of “biofilm engineering” can be extended to other biofilm parameters such as mechanical stability and the implication for biofilm control/removal in engineered water systems (e.g., pipelines and/or, cooling towers) susceptible to biofouling. © 2021","controlling the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by engineering biofilm physical structure the application of membrane technology for water treatment and reuse is hampered by the development of a microbial biofilm. biofilm growth in micro-and ultrafiltration (mf/uf) membrane modules, on both the membrane surface and feed spacer, can form a secondary membrane and exert resistance to permeation and crossflow, increasing energy demand and decreasing permeate quantity and quality. in recent years, exhaustive efforts were made to understand the chemical, structural and hydraulic characteristics of membrane biofilms. in this review, we critically assess which specific structural features of membrane biofilms exert resistance to forced water passage in mf/uf membranes systems applied to water and wastewater treatment, and how biofilm physical structure can be engineered by process operation to impose less hydraulic resistance (“below-the-pain threshold”). counter-intuitively, biofilms with greater thickness do not always cause a higher hydraulic resistance than thinner biofilms. dense biofilms, however, had consistently higher hydraulic resistances compared to less dense biofilms. the mechanism by which density exerts hydraulic resistance is reported in the literature to be dependant on the biofilms’ internal packing structure and eps chemical composition (e.g., porosity, polymer concentration). current reports of internal porosity in membrane biofilms are not supported by adequate experimental evidence or by a reliable methodology, limiting a unified understanding of biofilm internal structure. identifying the dependency of hydraulic resistance on biofilm density invites efforts to control the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms by engineering internal biofilm structure. regulation of biofilm internal structure is possible by alteration of key determinants such as feed water nutrient composition/concentration, hydraulic shear stress and resistance and can engineer biofilm structural development to decrease density and therein hydraulic resistance. future efforts should seek to determine the extent to which the concept of “biofilm engineering” can be extended to other biofilm parameters such as mechanical stability and the implication for biofilm control/removal in engineered water systems (e.g., pipelines and/or, cooling towers) susceptible to biofouling. © 2021",1,water,0.9069167375564575

2022,a simple method to establish sufficiency and stability in meta‐analyses: with application to fine particulate matter air pollution and preterm birth,"fine particulate matter air pollution (pm2.5) is a potential cause of preterm birth. incon-sistent findings from observational studies have motivated researchers to conduct more studies, but some degree of study heterogeneity is inevitable. the consequence of this feedback is a burgeoning research effort that results in marginal gains. the aim of this study was to develop and apply a method to establish the sufficiency and stability of estimates of associations as they have been published over time. cohort studies identified in a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis on the association between preterm birth and whole‐pregnancy exposure to pm2.5 were selected. the estimates of the cohort studies were pooled with cumulative meta‐analysis, whereby a new meta‐anal-ysis was run for each new study published over time. the relative risks (rr) and 95% confidence interval (ci) limits needed for a new study to move the cumulative rr to 1.00 were calculated. findings indicate that the cumulative relative risks (crr) for pm2.5 (crr 1.07, 95% ci 1.03, 1.12) con-verged in 2015 (rr 1.07, 95% ci 1.01, 1.14). to change conclusions to a null association, a new study would need to observe a protective rr of 0.93 (95% ci limit 1.02) with precision equivalent to that achieved by all past 24 cohort studies combined. preterm birth is associated with elevated pm2.5, and it is highly unlikely that any new observational study will alter this conclusion. consequently, establishing whether an observational association exists is now less relevant an objective for future studies than characterising risk (magnitude, impact, pathways, populations and potential bias) and interventions. sufficiency and stability can be effectively applied in meta‐analyses and have the potential to reduce research waste. © 2022 by the author. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.","a simple method to establish sufficiency and stability in meta‐analyses: with application to fine particulate matter air pollution and preterm birth fine particulate matter air pollution (pm2.5) is a potential cause of preterm birth. incon-sistent findings from observational studies have motivated researchers to conduct more studies, but some degree of study heterogeneity is inevitable. the consequence of this feedback is a burgeoning research effort that results in marginal gains. the aim of this study was to develop and apply a method to establish the sufficiency and stability of estimates of associations as they have been published over time. cohort studies identified in a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis on the association between preterm birth and whole‐pregnancy exposure to pm2.5 were selected. the estimates of the cohort studies were pooled with cumulative meta‐analysis, whereby a new meta‐anal-ysis was run for each new study published over time. the relative risks (rr) and 95% confidence interval (ci) limits needed for a new study to move the cumulative rr to 1.00 were calculated. findings indicate that the cumulative relative risks (crr) for pm2.5 (crr 1.07, 95% ci 1.03, 1.12) con-verged in 2015 (rr 1.07, 95% ci 1.01, 1.14). to change conclusions to a null association, a new study would need to observe a protective rr of 0.93 (95% ci limit 1.02) with precision equivalent to that achieved by all past 24 cohort studies combined. preterm birth is associated with elevated pm2.5, and it is highly unlikely that any new observational study will alter this conclusion. consequently, establishing whether an observational association exists is now less relevant an objective for future studies than characterising risk (magnitude, impact, pathways, populations and potential bias) and interventions. sufficiency and stability can be effectively applied in meta‐analyses and have the potential to reduce research waste. © 2022 by the author. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",2,air,0.9533348679542542

2022,petroleum hydrocarbon composition of oily sludge and contaminated soils in a decommissioned oilfield waste pit under desert conditions,"field and laboratory investigations were conducted to characterize the composition of petroleum hydrocarbons in oily sludge and the underlying contaminated soils in a decommissioned oilfield waste pit in kuwait. the results show that the petroleum hydrocarbon composition in the oily sludge and contaminated soils was spatially variable. highly toxic petroleum hydrocarbon species such as btex and pahs were generally lacking, and both sludge-and soil-borne hydrocarbons were dominated by long-chain petroleum hydrocarbons. the soil contamination depth was generally very shallow although localized deep profiles (>0.5 m) were found. a loose relationship was established between tph in the sludge and that in the underlying soil. on average, the soil had a greater percentage of shorter-chain hydrocarbon fractions (either aliphatics or aromatics), as compared to the sludge. the environmental risk from the oily sludge and contaminated soils is considered to be relatively low. for cost-effective management of the environmental risk of decommissioning an oilfield waste pit, containment of the sludge and contaminated soils using a soil-capping approach may be sufficient to minimize the possible adverse environmental impacts from the decommissioned waste pit, and this may represent an option that is superior to other costly remediation strategies. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.","petroleum hydrocarbon composition of oily sludge and contaminated soils in a decommissioned oilfield waste pit under desert conditions field and laboratory investigations were conducted to characterize the composition of petroleum hydrocarbons in oily sludge and the underlying contaminated soils in a decommissioned oilfield waste pit in kuwait. the results show that the petroleum hydrocarbon composition in the oily sludge and contaminated soils was spatially variable. highly toxic petroleum hydrocarbon species such as btex and pahs were generally lacking, and both sludge-and soil-borne hydrocarbons were dominated by long-chain petroleum hydrocarbons. the soil contamination depth was generally very shallow although localized deep profiles (>0.5 m) were found. a loose relationship was established between tph in the sludge and that in the underlying soil. on average, the soil had a greater percentage of shorter-chain hydrocarbon fractions (either aliphatics or aromatics), as compared to the sludge. the environmental risk from the oily sludge and contaminated soils is considered to be relatively low. for cost-effective management of the environmental risk of decommissioning an oilfield waste pit, containment of the sludge and contaminated soils using a soil-capping approach may be sufficient to minimize the possible adverse environmental impacts from the decommissioned waste pit, and this may represent an option that is superior to other costly remediation strategies. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",0,soil,0.9934751391410828
2022,how to build a microplastics-free environment: strategies for microplastics degradation and plastics recycling,"microplastics are an emergent yet critical issue for the environment because of high degradation resistance and bioaccumulation. unfortunately, the current technologies to remove, recycle, or degrade microplastics are insufficient for complete elimination. in addition, the fragmentation and degradation of mismanaged plastic wastes in environment have recently been identified as a significant source of microplastics. thus, the developments of effective microplastics removal methods, as well as, plastics recycling strategies are crucial to build a microplastics-free environment. herein, this review comprehensively summarizes the current technologies for eliminating microplastics from the environment and highlights two key aspects to achieve this goal: 1) catalytic degradation of microplastics into environmentally friendly organics (carbon dioxide and water); 2) catalytic recycling and upcycling plastic wastes into monomers, fuels, and valorized chemicals. the mechanisms, catalysts, feasibility, and challenges of these methods are also discussed. novel catalytic methods such as, photocatalysis, advanced oxidation process, and biotechnology are promising and eco-friendly candidates to transform microplastics and plastic wastes into environmentally benign and valuable products. in the future, more effort is encouraged to develop eco-friendly methods for the catalytic conversion of plastics into valuable products with high efficiency, high product selectivity, and low cost under mild conditions. © 2022 the authors.","how to build a microplastics-free environment: strategies for microplastics degradation and plastics recycling microplastics are an emergent yet critical issue for the environment because of high degradation resistance and bioaccumulation. unfortunately, the current technologies to remove, recycle, or degrade microplastics are insufficient for complete elimination. in addition, the fragmentation and degradation of mismanaged plastic wastes in environment have recently been identified as a significant source of microplastics. thus, the developments of effective microplastics removal methods, as well as, plastics recycling strategies are crucial to build a microplastics-free environment. herein, this review comprehensively summarizes the current technologies for eliminating microplastics from the environment and highlights two key aspects to achieve this goal: 1) catalytic degradation of microplastics into environmentally friendly organics (carbon dioxide and water); 2) catalytic recycling and upcycling plastic wastes into monomers, fuels, and valorized chemicals. the mechanisms, catalysts, feasibility, and challenges of these methods are also discussed. novel catalytic methods such as, photocatalysis, advanced oxidation process, and biotechnology are promising and eco-friendly candidates to transform microplastics and plastic wastes into environmentally benign and valuable products. in the future, more effort is encouraged to develop eco-friendly methods for the catalytic conversion of plastics into valuable products with high efficiency, high product selectivity, and low cost under mild conditions. © 2022 the authors.",1,water,0.9600017070770264

2022,the optimal design and operation of a hybrid renewable micro-grid with the decoupled liquid air energy storage,"this study explores the multiple functions of liquid air energy storage (laes) in a hybrid renewable micro-grid, which hasn't been covered so far, to decarbonize the distributed energy systems that are increasingly popular. to cope with this, a decoupled off-design laes model was developed, and integrated into a micro-grid mixed-integer linear programming (milp) design framework. this methodology enables studying the optimal energy to power ratios of laes, and the identification of specific value streams of the storage, as well as optimally sizing the micro-grid equipment and laes units simultaneously, to achieve the balanced economics and environmental benefits. the simulation has led to three major results. firstly, the optimal charge/discharge power and storage capacity of laes vary with the services it provides. the optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio are 8/3 h, 12/6 h and 12/6 h corresponding to the arbitrage, wind stabilization and operating reserve. secondly, for a micro-grid with ∼50% of wind power, laes presents the key value in supporting the system operation by providing multiple functions. it is split into six explicit revenue streams that can be stacked up for the first time, including the time shifting (13.2%), renewable firming (11.4%), peak shaving (28%), flexibility (21%) and reserve value (20.4%), as well as the waste heat recovery (6%). thirdly, in comparison with the mildly reduced laes capital cost and enlarged electricity price differences, a higher renewable percentage would be a major driving force to increase the attractiveness of laes in micro-grids. the system design framework can determine the optimal sizes of the micro-grid components and the laes units. specifically, the optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio (27/14 h) and the storage tank size (608 t) of laes in a micro-grid with 75% wind power are obtained, leading to ∼60% of carbon emission reduction on the 2016 level. the importance of this work lies in it provides the preliminary business model of applying small-scale laes in hybrid renewable micro-grids, and can promote the optimal deployment of laes under different scenarios in micro-grids. © 2021","the optimal design and operation of a hybrid renewable micro-grid with the decoupled liquid air energy storage this study explores the multiple functions of liquid air energy storage (laes) in a hybrid renewable micro-grid, which hasn't been covered so far, to decarbonize the distributed energy systems that are increasingly popular. to cope with this, a decoupled off-design laes model was developed, and integrated into a micro-grid mixed-integer linear programming (milp) design framework. this methodology enables studying the optimal energy to power ratios of laes, and the identification of specific value streams of the storage, as well as optimally sizing the micro-grid equipment and laes units simultaneously, to achieve the balanced economics and environmental benefits. the simulation has led to three major results. firstly, the optimal charge/discharge power and storage capacity of laes vary with the services it provides. the optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio are 8/3 h, 12/6 h and 12/6 h corresponding to the arbitrage, wind stabilization and operating reserve. secondly, for a micro-grid with ∼50% of wind power, laes presents the key value in supporting the system operation by providing multiple functions. it is split into six explicit revenue streams that can be stacked up for the first time, including the time shifting (13.2%), renewable firming (11.4%), peak shaving (28%), flexibility (21%) and reserve value (20.4%), as well as the waste heat recovery (6%). thirdly, in comparison with the mildly reduced laes capital cost and enlarged electricity price differences, a higher renewable percentage would be a major driving force to increase the attractiveness of laes in micro-grids. the system design framework can determine the optimal sizes of the micro-grid components and the laes units. specifically, the optimal charge/discharge energy to power ratio (27/14 h) and the storage tank size (608 t) of laes in a micro-grid with 75% wind power are obtained, leading to ∼60% of carbon emission reduction on the 2016 level. the importance of this work lies in it provides the preliminary business model of applying small-scale laes in hybrid renewable micro-grids, and can promote the optimal deployment of laes under different scenarios in micro-grids. © 2021",2,air,0.9646620750427246

2022,"tyre rubber and expansive soils: two hazards, one solution","this paper presents the results of an experimental programme using shredded waste tyre rubber to reinforce expansive soils. soil samples were reinforced with fine and coarse rubber particles at four different contents by weight. the rubber-reinforced soils were then subjected to unconfined compression, split tensile, direct shear and desiccation-induced crack tests. improvements in cracking intensity and shear strength were found with higher rubber contents. however, rubber contents greater than 10% raised failure concerns during compression and/or tension, attributed to clustering of rubber particles under non-confinement test conditions. although the coarser rubber slightly outperformed the finer rubber, the effect of larger rubber size was mainly translated to higher ductility, lower stiffness and higher energy adsorption capacity rather than peak strength improvements. the swelling properties previously investigated by the authors were revisited and cross-checked with the strength-related features to arrive at the optimum rubber content. in this case, 10% rubber was found to result in a notable decrease in the swell-shrink (and hence cracking) capacity as well as improving the strength-related properties and thus was deemed as the optimum choice. © 2019 ice publishing: all rights reserved.","tyre rubber and expansive soils: two hazards, one solution this paper presents the results of an experimental programme using shredded waste tyre rubber to reinforce expansive soils. soil samples were reinforced with fine and coarse rubber particles at four different contents by weight. the rubber-reinforced soils were then subjected to unconfined compression, split tensile, direct shear and desiccation-induced crack tests. improvements in cracking intensity and shear strength were found with higher rubber contents. however, rubber contents greater than 10% raised failure concerns during compression and/or tension, attributed to clustering of rubber particles under non-confinement test conditions. although the coarser rubber slightly outperformed the finer rubber, the effect of larger rubber size was mainly translated to higher ductility, lower stiffness and higher energy adsorption capacity rather than peak strength improvements. the swelling properties previously investigated by the authors were revisited and cross-checked with the strength-related features to arrive at the optimum rubber content. in this case, 10% rubber was found to result in a notable decrease in the swell-shrink (and hence cracking) capacity as well as improving the strength-related properties and thus was deemed as the optimum choice. © 2019 ice publishing: all rights reserved.",0,soil,0.9550807476043701
2022,diclofenac biotransformation in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process,"diclofenac is a pharmaceutical active compound frequently detected in wastewater and water bodies, and often reported to be persistent and difficult to biodegrade. while many previous studies have focussed on assessing diclofenac biodegradation in nitrification and denitrification processes, this study focusses on diclofenac biodegradation in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (ebpr) process, where the efficiency of this process for diclofenac biodegradation as well as the metabolites generated are not well understood. an enrichment of accumulibacter polyphosphate accumulating organisms (paos) was operated in an sbr for over 300 d, and acclimatized to 20 μg/l of diclofenac, which is in a similar range to that observed in domestic wastewater influents. the diclofenac biotransformation was monitored in four periods of stable operation and linked to the microbial community and metabolic behaviour in each period. nitrification was observed in two of the four periods despite the addition of a nitrification inhibitor, and these periods were positively correlated with increased diclofenac biodegradation. interestingly, in two periods with excellent phosphorus removal (>99%) and no nitrification, different levels of diclofenac biotransformation were observed. period 2, enriched in accumulibacter type ii achieved more significant diclofenac biotransformation (3.4 μg/gx), while period 4, enriched in accumulibacter type i achieved lower diclofenac biotransformation (0.4 μg/gx). in total, 23 transformation products were identified, with lower toxicity than the parent compound, enabling the elucidation of multiple metabolic pathways for diclofenac biotransformation. this study showed that paos can contribute to diclofenac biotransformation, yielding less toxic transformation products, and can complement the biodegradation carried out by other organisms in activated sludge, particularly nitrifiers. © 2021 elsevier b.v.","diclofenac biotransformation in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process diclofenac is a pharmaceutical active compound frequently detected in wastewater and water bodies, and often reported to be persistent and difficult to biodegrade. while many previous studies have focussed on assessing diclofenac biodegradation in nitrification and denitrification processes, this study focusses on diclofenac biodegradation in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (ebpr) process, where the efficiency of this process for diclofenac biodegradation as well as the metabolites generated are not well understood. an enrichment of accumulibacter polyphosphate accumulating organisms (paos) was operated in an sbr for over 300 d, and acclimatized to 20 μg/l of diclofenac, which is in a similar range to that observed in domestic wastewater influents. the diclofenac biotransformation was monitored in four periods of stable operation and linked to the microbial community and metabolic behaviour in each period. nitrification was observed in two of the four periods despite the addition of a nitrification inhibitor, and these periods were positively correlated with increased diclofenac biodegradation. interestingly, in two periods with excellent phosphorus removal (>99%) and no nitrification, different levels of diclofenac biotransformation were observed. period 2, enriched in accumulibacter type ii achieved more significant diclofenac biotransformation (3.4 μg/gx), while period 4, enriched in accumulibacter type i achieved lower diclofenac biotransformation (0.4 μg/gx). in total, 23 transformation products were identified, with lower toxicity than the parent compound, enabling the elucidation of multiple metabolic pathways for diclofenac biotransformation. this study showed that paos can contribute to diclofenac biotransformation, yielding less toxic transformation products, and can complement the biodegradation carried out by other organisms in activated sludge, particularly nitrifiers. © 2021 elsevier b.v.",1,water,0.9025091528892517

2022,evolution of pyrite oxidation from a 10-year kinetic leach study: implications for secondary mineralisation in acid mine drainage control,"acid rock drainage (ard) is generated when mineral sulfides, primarily pyrite (fes2), are exposed to weathering. pyrite oxidation and dissolution may also result in the precipitation of secondary sulfate minerals, commonly found in weathered mine wastes, that release ‘stored acidity’ on subsequent dissolution. to better understand the release of this stored acidity, a kinetic leach column experiment using a synthetic pyritic (5 wt%) mine waste was conducted for a period of 524 weeks. the first 260 weeks watering/flushing was carried out using milli-q water during which the leachate ph decreased from 6.0 to 2.0, pyrite passivation layers present initially were removed and secondary sulfate minerals formed. the rate at which acidity was generated from secondary sulfate mineral dissolution was significantly greater than from pyrite oxidation after the calcite-saturated silicate water treatment during the period from 260 to 440 weeks. this suggests that in weathered pyritic wastes, both the amount of acidity and the rate at which it is released may be dominated by acid sulfate minerals rather than residual pyrite. importantly, it was found that passivation strategies appropriate for reducing pyrite oxidation rates were not effective for reducing the rate of acid release from secondary mineralisation. significant amounts of lime-saturated water (with high alkalinity) were required to dissolve the secondary sulfate minerals containing the stored acidity before circum-neutral conditions necessary for pyrite passivation could be achieved. it follows therefore that it is necessary to quantify the amount of stored acidity in secondary minerals so that appropriate remediation and acid management strategies can be designed and implemented to achieve long-term sustainable ard control and mine closure. © 2021 elsevier b.v.","evolution of pyrite oxidation from a 10-year kinetic leach study: implications for secondary mineralisation in acid mine drainage control acid rock drainage (ard) is generated when mineral sulfides, primarily pyrite (fes2), are exposed to weathering. pyrite oxidation and dissolution may also result in the precipitation of secondary sulfate minerals, commonly found in weathered mine wastes, that release ‘stored acidity’ on subsequent dissolution. to better understand the release of this stored acidity, a kinetic leach column experiment using a synthetic pyritic (5 wt%) mine waste was conducted for a period of 524 weeks. the first 260 weeks watering/flushing was carried out using milli-q water during which the leachate ph decreased from 6.0 to 2.0, pyrite passivation layers present initially were removed and secondary sulfate minerals formed. the rate at which acidity was generated from secondary sulfate mineral dissolution was significantly greater than from pyrite oxidation after the calcite-saturated silicate water treatment during the period from 260 to 440 weeks. this suggests that in weathered pyritic wastes, both the amount of acidity and the rate at which it is released may be dominated by acid sulfate minerals rather than residual pyrite. importantly, it was found that passivation strategies appropriate for reducing pyrite oxidation rates were not effective for reducing the rate of acid release from secondary mineralisation. significant amounts of lime-saturated water (with high alkalinity) were required to dissolve the secondary sulfate minerals containing the stored acidity before circum-neutral conditions necessary for pyrite passivation could be achieved. it follows therefore that it is necessary to quantify the amount of stored acidity in secondary minerals so that appropriate remediation and acid management strategies can be designed and implemented to achieve long-term sustainable ard control and mine closure. © 2021 elsevier b.v.",1,water,0.8921194672584534

2022,climate change impact on the closure design for the rehabilitation of the former rum jungle uranium mine,"the former rum jungle uranium mine, located approximately 100 km south of darwin, operated between 1954 and 1971 and underwent rehabilitation from 1983 to 1986. the rehabilitation addressed significant environmental impacts caused by acid metalliferous drainage and achieved objectives related to reducing public health hazards. however, recent studies documented that the original rehabilitation works do not meet modern environmental standards, meaning further rehabilitation work would be required for site closure and relinquishment. an improved rehabilitation strategy, consistent with the views and interests of stakeholders and that meets contemporary environmental and mined-land rehabilitation standards, was developed in 2020. the strategy involves relocation of potentially acid forming waste rock to new surface waste storage facilities (wsfs) and a water and tailings filled pit, treatment of contaminated pit and groundwater, and the realignment of the east branch finniss river (ebfr) to follow its original course back through the pit. there is now widespread acceptance that human activities are contributing to observed climate change. continued emissions of greenhouse gases are highly likely to cause changes in all components of the climate system. the northern territory government requested that the effects of long-term climate change on specific aspects of the proposed rehabilitation design be assessed. based on the un's intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report (ar5; ipcc 2014), and australia's csiro and bureau of meteorology (csiro & bom 2015) climate change projections, regional highlights relevant to the project site include warming between 0.5°c and 5.1°c, dry season changes projected to range from 45% drier to 44% wetter, and, for the wet season, 23% drier to 19% wetter. additionally, fire weather will become more frequent and harsher. key climate change indicators likely to influence the rehabilitation design are considered to be climate change-induced rainfall, especially peak intensity rainfall events, and climate change impacts on fire weather, considering both the potential for a catastrophic fire decimating the vegetation throughout the project site catchment, and how the intense heat from an extreme bush fire might change the structure of the soil, resulting in hydrophobic conditions. the effect of the above potential climate change-related factors has been studied to ascertain the robustness of the specific rehabilitation design elements, including backfilling of the pit, realignment of the ebfr and the erosion of the wsfs. the key findings of the study have shown that the primary impacts of climate change on the success of the rehabilitation are changes to flow regime and flood levels within the ebfr, with an increase in peak flood levels of between 50 mm and 600 mm. however, the flood level increase would not exceed the defined channel and therefore would not inundate the proposed wsf footprints; hence, no specific mitigation will be required. increased creek flow velocities would require enhanced erosion and scour protection immediately upstream and downstream of the main pit. other drainage structure design upgrades would also be required to mitigate the effects of increased flows. modelling of the wsfs to account for climate change effects has shown the maximum gully erosion after 500 years is less than 1.3 m, providing contingency compared to the 2.5 m cover design thickness. spatially, less than 1% of the erosion will be of a depth greater than 1 m. under both base case and climate change scenarios, the type and rate of revegetation is critical to controlling erosion. the final revegetation plan should carefully consider how climate change influences can impact the type and extent of vegetation used. © 2022 australian centre for geomechanics, perth.","climate change impact on the closure design for the rehabilitation of the former rum jungle uranium mine the former rum jungle uranium mine, located approximately 100 km south of darwin, operated between 1954 and 1971 and underwent rehabilitation from 1983 to 1986. the rehabilitation addressed significant environmental impacts caused by acid metalliferous drainage and achieved objectives related to reducing public health hazards. however, recent studies documented that the original rehabilitation works do not meet modern environmental standards, meaning further rehabilitation work would be required for site closure and relinquishment. an improved rehabilitation strategy, consistent with the views and interests of stakeholders and that meets contemporary environmental and mined-land rehabilitation standards, was developed in 2020. the strategy involves relocation of potentially acid forming waste rock to new surface waste storage facilities (wsfs) and a water and tailings filled pit, treatment of contaminated pit and groundwater, and the realignment of the east branch finniss river (ebfr) to follow its original course back through the pit. there is now widespread acceptance that human activities are contributing to observed climate change. continued emissions of greenhouse gases are highly likely to cause changes in all components of the climate system. the northern territory government requested that the effects of long-term climate change on specific aspects of the proposed rehabilitation design be assessed. based on the un's intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report (ar5;

2022,monitoring outcomes of rehabilitation of large-scale exploration disturbance: what is the role of remote sensing?,"mineral exploration in australia can extend across vast areas of land, often in remote locations. the nature of disturbance within exploration areas varies but typically includes vegetation clearing along tracks and around drill pads. in western australia, the department of mines, industry regulation and safety recently announced a strengthening of its approach to rehabilitation compliance monitoring in relation to exploration (government of western australia 2020). compliance generally focuses on the prompt completion of activities such as plugging drill holes, filling sumps, removing waste, redistributing topsoil and surface scarification. however, less emphasis has been paid to the long-term (beyond six months) environmental outcomes of exploration rehabilitation, compared to rehabilitation of mine sites more broadly. approaches to ecological monitoring are evolving in line with increasing access to high quality imagery with a range of spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, and advances in image analysis techniques. in 2020, rio tinto engaged stantec to trial the use of a remote sensing approach for compliance monitoring of 33 exploration areas distributed across the pilbara bioregion. the areas had been disturbed for exploration in line with conditions associated with exploration approvals and were distributed across an area exceeding 200, 000 hectares (ha). the first step in the development of a remote sensing assessment involves choosing a suitable data capture approach. in this study, given the importance of accurately delineating live vegetation cover, and the large-scale of the area to be assessed, multispectral (4-band) satellite imagery (skysat, planet) at 50 cm spatial resolution was selected. an object-based image analysis (obia) approach was applied to the captured imagery at each site in order to accurately quantify ground cover. cover was allocated into separate classes: live vegetation, bare or sparsely vegetated ground, litter, shadow and any remaining 'other' features. given that the spatial data available prior to the analysis was limited to drill pad points, rather than the entire disturbance boundary, obia was also used to delineate a disturbance area. the remaining area was categorised as analogue and its classification data was extracted separately for comparative purposes. the 33 areas assessed ranged in size from 30 to 39, 000 ha. the proportion of each area detected by obia as 'disturbance' ranged from 0.1% to 30%. the number of drill pads located within each site ranged from six to nearly 600. at some of the smaller areas, the majority of drill pads were located within the obia-delineated disturbance area. however, at other sites, up to 90% of the drill pads were located outside the disturbance area, indicating that they had sufficient vegetation attributes to align more closely with the areas delineated as 'analogue'. a number of sites contained a range of drill pad ages, and at selected sites, a positive correlation between vegetation cover and rehabilitation age was established, an indicator of rehabilitation progress. typically, on-ground compliance monitoring of exploration disturbance has involved photo-monitoring and qualitative assessments of soil and vegetation, requiring travel to each disturbed site, often in remote locations. this project demonstrated that remote sensing is an effective alternative for assessment, particularly where exploration extends over a large area, allowing data capture over an entire area as opposed to point source information, while removing safety risks. however, the outcomes of a remote sensing approach may differ considerably from that of a traditional on-ground assessment. the outcomes, limitations, risks and future directions in monitoring rehabilitated exploration disturbance are discussed further in this study. © 2022 australian centre for geomechanics, perth.","monitoring outcomes of rehabilitation of large-scale exploration disturbance: what is the role of remote sensing?

2022,developing a systematic model to rehabilitate key domains of gold mines for environmental sustainability,"the primary focus of the mine rehabilitation model is to eliminate the acid metalliferous

is aligned with industry-recognised guidelines, standards with applicable government regulations, integration design methods and innovative technologies, establishing an optimum performance platform for sustainable rehabilitation management. cosmo howley project area (chpa) is located 130 km southeast of darwin, between adelaide river and pine creek. the nearest township is adelaide river, 50 km to the northwest. the chpa is operated by agnico eagle nt mining operations (ntmo). the most significant environmental risk at the chpa is represented by the wrds, which are the key source of amd, impacting on the local creeks and groundwater quality. the issue is unlikely to abate in the foreseeable future unless the amd source is removed. the ineffective design of the wrds, limited geochemical characterisation and the highly seasonal tropical rainfall patterns at chpa compounds the problem with respect to the formulation of a cost-effective, permanent rehabilitation strategy. longer term, and as part of this mine rehabilitation strategy, ntmo propose to control amd via oxidation control. this will be achieved by rehandling of waste rock from howley and mottrams wrd and placement in-pit in the cosmo pit, below the recovery watertable level, which will provide an effective barrier to significant oxygen diffusion. other environmental risk areas include large dams within the chpa that store the residue of heavy metal contaminated soil. ntmo adopted biological treatment to ameliorate the acid sulphate soil within these receptors. naturally occurring biological micro-organisms and plants able to withstand high concentrations of heavy metals can be useful in eradicating hazardous contaminants. this is a process known as bioremediation and is an eco-friendly and efficient method of reclaiming environments contaminated with heavy metals. biological treatment can be combined with physical processes, such as anionic clay precipitation. the clay binds to metals and other contaminants, which make the toxic metal inactive. biological treatment can then add nutrient to the soil to promote vegetation growth. a trial treatment investigation was implemented

2022,accelerating soil formation in bauxite residue: a solution for long-term tailings management and storage,"bauxite residue is the highly alkaline (ph ~12) and saline tailings material produced during the bayer process for alumina production. australia is currently responsible for the management of approximately 750 million tonnes of bauxite residue and produces an additional 30 million tonnes each year. currently only 2% of bauxite residue produced is recycled (international aluminium institute 2017, di carlo et al. 2019a); however, there is growing interest in reusing residue by transforming this byproduct into a productive soil material through in situ remediation. this aims to transform the bauxite residue into a soil-like medium, by adding amendments to the residue to reduce ph and salinity and improve other unfavourable conditions. our work has focused on optimising the amendment application used to accelerate soil formation, using field scale lysimeters to test a combination of treatments. here we provide an overview of a successful year-long field trial to promote soil formation, and our key insights from the trial. combining microbially-driven bioremediation with common amendments compost and tillage accelerated ph neutralisation of the residue and leaching of excess salts, creating a material amenable to plant growth. the trials were completed under harsh australian climatic conditions utilising available mine site water and cost-effective amendment rates, ensuring that this technology is applicable for further industrial scale-up. the data from this study will allow development of best practice remediation strategies for bauxite residue deposits based on their climate and desired end land use and is also applicable to other alkaline tailings and waste materials. our results with bauxite residue show that in situ remediation is an innovative solution for rapid, cost-effective long-term tailings management. © 2022 australian centre for geomechanics, perth.","accelerating soil formation in bauxite residue: a solution for long-term tailings management and storage bauxite residue is the highly alkaline (ph ~12) and saline tailings material produced during the bayer process for alumina production. australia is currently responsible for the management of approximately 750 million tonnes of bauxite residue and produces an additional 30 million tonnes each year. currently only 2% of bauxite residue produced is recycled (international aluminium institute 2017, di carlo et al. 2019a); however, there is growing interest in reusing residue by transforming this byproduct into a productive soil material through in situ remediation. this aims to transform the bauxite residue into a soil-like medium, by adding amendments to the residue to reduce ph and salinity and improve other unfavourable conditions. our work has focused on optimising the amendment application used to accelerate soil formation, using field scale lysimeters to test a combination of treatments. here we provide an overview of a successful year-long field trial to promote soil formation, and our key insights from the trial. combining microbially-driven bioremediation with common amendments compost and tillage accelerated ph neutralisation of the residue and leaching of excess salts, creating a material amenable to plant growth. the trials were completed under harsh australian climatic conditions utilising available mine site water and cost-effective amendment rates, ensuring that this technology is applicable for further industrial scale-up. the data from this study will allow development of best practice remediation strategies for bauxite residue deposits based on their climate and desired end land use and is also applicable to other alkaline tailings and waste materials. our results with bauxite residue show that in situ remediation is an innovative solution for rapid, cost-effective long-term tailings management. © 2022 australian centre for geomechanics, perth.",0,soil,0.9837422370910645
2022,"marra mamba south waste rock dump cover system field trial autopsy, tom price mine, western australia","cover systems are layered materials designed to create an interface between underlying waste rock material and the receiving environment. two cover system field trials were constructed on the marra mamba south (mms) waste rock dump (wrd) at tom price mine in 2003: test plot one (tp1) comprised banded iron formation (bif) and test plot two (tp2) comprised oxidised mount mcrae shale (mcs). both test plots used the moisture 'store-and-release' cover design concept that acts to limit infiltration of atmospheric water, provide a buffer layer reducing the potential for upward migration of salts, and support resilient native vegetation growth. the aim of the field trials was to assess the performance of the constructed cover systems. okane completed an in situ autopsy of the mcs test plot in 2021, prior to decommissioning of the field trials. the autopsy provided an opportunity to assess the geotechnical and geochemical evolution of the cover system material after 17 years of climate cycling, measure the influence of cover system material type on plant health, determine root distributions through the cover system material, and decommission in situ performance monitoring equipment. material characterisation of the cover system material included the analysis of fertility, element enrichment and mobility, particle size distribution, and soil water retention. results were compared to similar works carried out over the 17-year lifespan of the field trials to indicate the degree to which the cover system degraded over time. vegetation root analysis and tap root tracing indicated the presence of acacia and senna species roots within the cover system material (0-2.4 m) and extending to 3 m into the underlying waste rock. roots of native grass species (poaceae) were present in the cover system material but were not detected in the underlying waste rock. material characterisation findings indicate the mcs is a suitable material for cover system design from a stability perspective and to support the establishment of native vegetation cover. findings on root depth analysis can be used to inform suitable seed mixes to minimise risks related to potentially acid forming wrds. the autopsy demonstrated minimal degradation of the mcs cover system profile over its 17-year lifespan and indicated that mcs is a suitable material for use in store-and-release cover systems for landforms in the pilbara. © 2022 australian centre for

2022,"review of mine waste capping methodologies for use in semi-arid regions of queensland, australia","the paper reviews conventional surface mine waste management practices and the development of capping methodologies over potentially contaminating mine wastes using soil covers. the paper then focuses on the store and release cover system appropriate for the tops of potentially contaminating mine waste storages in the semi-arid regions of queensland, australia. the treatment and drainage of the slopes of such mine waste storages are also described. in queensland, the queensland estimated rehabilitation cost user guide (erc user guide) recommends soil cover layers and their thicknesses for the risk category assigned to stored mine wastes. the paper outlines the recommendations of the erc user guide and offers commentaries on their application in semi-arid regions of queensland. it is noted that the erc user guide does not specify cover designs for different climatic settings, nor the materials or placement to be applied to the layers defined, which are key to the success of a cover system. rather, the focus is on assigning a risk category to the stored mine wastes, covering both chemical and physical risks, and specifying the type and thickness of cover layers for that risk category. attention should focus on the design, materials selection, and construction of mine waste covers to ensure that they are appropriate for the mine wastes stored and the climatic setting of the site. further, the erc user guide does not specify the slope angle and treatment for waste rock dumps (wrds), heap leach pads and tailings storage facilities, but presumes 'reprofiling', which forms the basis for estimating slope rehabilitation costs. leaving angle of repose non-acid forming wrd slopes is not considered in the erc user guide, despite it being successfully applied at a number of mine sites in queensland. the erc user guide states that “drainage is typically required on the finished cap to ensure that surface water drains off the cap”, despite this concentrating rainfall runoff. © 2022 australian centre for geomechanics, perth.","review of mine waste capping methodologies for use in semi-arid regions of queensland, australia the paper reviews conventional surface mine waste management practices and the development of capping methodologies over potentially contaminating mine wastes using soil covers. the paper then focuses on the store and release cover system appropriate for the tops of potentially contaminating mine waste storages in the semi-arid regions of queensland, australia. the treatment and drainage of the slopes of such mine waste storages are also described. in queensland, the queensland estimated rehabilitation cost user guide (erc user guide) recommends soil cover layers and their thicknesses for the risk category assigned to stored mine wastes. the paper outlines the recommendations of the erc user guide and offers commentaries on their application in semi-arid regions of queensland. it is noted that the erc user guide does not specify cover designs for different climatic settings, nor the materials or placement to be applied to the layers defined, which are key to the success of a cover system. rather, the focus is on assigning a risk category to the stored mine wastes, covering both chemical and physical risks, and specifying the type and thickness of cover layers for that risk category. attention should focus on the design, materials selection, and construction of mine waste covers to ensure that they are appropriate for the mine wastes stored and the climatic setting of the site. further, the erc user guide does not specify the slope angle and treatment for waste rock dumps (wrds), heap leach pads and tailings storage facilities, but presumes 'reprofiling', which forms the basis for estimating slope rehabilitation costs. leaving angle of repose non-acid forming wrd slopes is not considered in the erc user guide, despite it being successfully applied at a number of mine sites in queensland. the erc user guide states that “drainage is typically required on the finished cap to ensure that surface water drains off the cap”, despite this concentrating rainfall runoff. © 2022 australian centre for geomechanics, perth.",0,soil,0.9934485554695129
2022,"a risk-based framework for assessing non-metalliferous contamination prior to closure at mmg rosebery mine, tasmania","mining operations often have long and complex development histories, which results in equally complex site contamination risks when approaching closure. in many cases, the environmental monitoring conducted during operation only targets the contaminants of concern associated with mineral concentrates, processing reagents, and metalliferous drainage from mine waste. at closure, the focus of environmental assessment expands from preventing offsite impacts from mineral contaminants to assessing potential impacts from all activities and contaminants used during operations based on the site's intended future use. therefore, the greatest environmental data gaps at closure can often be due to contaminants perceived to be a lower risk, many of which are common across all mines and industrial facilities. a risk-based framework has been developed to assess the contamination not associated with mineralised waste or mineral concentrates at mmg's rosebery mine in tasmania. the site has been operating continuously for over 85 years and is currently scheduled to cease operations in under a decade if additional tailings storage capacity cannot be secured. the assessment framework adopts a phased, risk-based approach that employs a range of assessment techniques that can be implemented prior to closure in a staged and cost-effective process, which does not affect current operation, including: • comprehensive site history and source risk-ranking tool. • ground penetrating radar. • groundwater investigation as a tool to assess contamination migrating from suspected source areas inaccessible during operation. • targeted soil assessments. • passive soil vapour. • per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (pfas) fingerprinting. the presentation will draw on examples from the contamination assessment for the rosebery closure pre-feasibility study where 76 features associated with mining infrastructure or operational practices have been identified with the potential to have resulted in soil, surface water, or groundwater contamination by non-metalliferous contaminants. of the 76 potential source areas, 64 were identified to have a moderate or higher risk to protected environmental values, and where further assessment and possibly remediation may be required to support relinquishment of the site. the risk-based approach identified a shortlist of priority features where a release of contamination may have occurred, and where early investigation and intervention was both feasible and beneficial due to an expanded range of remedial options. this presentation demonstrates the value of establishing a robust assessment framework early in a closure study so that a cost-effective, staged approach to contaminant assessment and remediation can be delivered to satisfy regulatory, internal and other stakeholder requirements. this proactive risk-based assessment approach provides opportunities to minimise future environmental impact, reduce total remediation costs, support stakeholder engagement and provide

how food is produced, processed and distributed, reflecting changes in agricultural methods, use of land, soil, water, fertilisers and chemicals, supply and distribution chains. more sustainable farming methods are currently being introduced in response to ecologically threatening trends as a result of land-use changes and use of chemicals. as distinct from the other concepts, sustainability transition does not describe an evolutionary pattern of changes but only the current most necessary transformation in development. it requires radical transformation and action towards reduced environmental footprints of all human activities, including food. china's development has experienced similar transitions although with unique features. its demographic transition has been influenced by the “one child policy” while the nutrition/protein transition has been fuelled by increasing income levels. industrialisation of food production with application of chemicals is widespread but more recently, organic methods of farming are gaining momentum. food security and production are recognised as a challenge and opportunity in china's sustainability transition with state-driven dietary efforts to contain domestic meat consumption. conclusion. china has the opportunity to play a prominent role in the global transition to improved food choices, as required by the current environment and climate emergency, by shifting its own eating habits and also contributing to the burgeoning field of new alternatives to livestock products. © 2022 national university of food technologies. all rights reserved.","china and changing food trends: a sustainability transition perspective introduction. global population has witnessed significant changes in the way food is produced and consumed. although this has benefitted population health, it has also contributed to climate change and unsustainable use of natural resources. materials and methods. сomprehensive literature review. results and discussion. the characteristics of four transition theories related to food are outlined to help explain population behaviour, namely demographic, nutrition/protein, food and sustainability transition. this is followed by a further desktop analysis of the changes occurring in china, the world's largest demography, and this country's contribution to a most-needed global sustainability transition. the theoretical framework of transition theories used since the mid-20th century outlines changes in population behaviour impacting relationships between people and more recently with the natural environment. as a multidisciplinary field describing fundamental shifts in human societies, transition theories are very insightful in relation to food and nutrition. the demographic transition links industrialisation with fertility and mortality rates but also with food availability. during the nutrition transition, a change occurs in people's calorie intakes from different food groups. while the share of protein remains relatively stable, the initial transition from plant- to animal-based foods now changes in reverse with increasing ecological and health awareness. this nutrition/protein transition can result in a better dietary behaviour with reduction in over-consumption, losses and waste. the food transition explains the transformations on the supply side -

2022,big data research on agricultural soil contamination by zeolite application,"food scarcity has become a global issue. the large amount of solid waste produced by cities every day generates an incalculable amount of toxic substances, including mercury, lead, iron and other heavy metals and harmful chemicals, as well as radionuclide ions, which can cause great harm to people’s health and safety when they are transferred to the soil, water, plants and air. excessive industrial development has led to the infiltration of high polymers and heavy metals into agricultural soil, endangering the health of our food. one other major factor impact-ing soil quality is the waste produced from construction sites; this waste is mostly backfilled directly into the local soil, causing varying degrees of secondary contamination. scientists have had to adopt various methods to adjust soil structure, change soil ph, as well as reduce the composition and content of heavy metals in the soil. among these different approaches, scientists find natural zeolites can improve soil quality and combat soil pollution. zeolite has excel-lent ion exchange and adsorption capacity, and is currently widely used as an environmentally friendly soil conditioner in many soil restoration and improvement fields such as ecological organic agriculture, urban soil pollution improvement, and artificial soil construction, which has very important social and economic values for improving soil quality and agricultural produc-tion. adding zeolite to the soil to be restored and improved in the city can effectively adsorb heavy metals and other substances. based on current research, we collected and obtained data from a large number of previous papers to evaluate the extent of zeolite’s effect on soil as well as plants, as scientists attempted to use zeolite to mitigate soil contamination. © 2022, polish society magnesium research. all rights reserved.","big data research on agricultural soil contamination by zeolite application food scarcity has become a global issue. the large amount of solid waste produced by cities every day generates an incalculable amount of toxic substances, including mercury, lead, iron and other heavy metals and harmful chemicals, as well as radionuclide ions, which can cause great harm to people’s health and safety when they are transferred to the soil, water, plants and air. excessive industrial development has led to the infiltration of high polymers and heavy metals into agricultural soil, endangering the health of our food. one other major factor impact-ing soil quality is the waste produced from construction sites; this waste is mostly backfilled directly into the local soil, causing varying degrees of secondary contamination. scientists have had to adopt various methods to adjust soil structure, change soil ph, as well as reduce the composition and content of heavy metals in the soil. among these different approaches, scientists find natural zeolites can improve soil quality and combat soil pollution. zeolite has excel-lent ion exchange and adsorption capacity, and is currently widely used as an environmentally friendly soil conditioner in many soil restoration and improvement fields such as ecological organic agriculture, urban soil pollution improvement, and artificial soil construction, which has very important social and economic values for improving soil quality and agricultural produc-tion. adding zeolite to the soil to be restored and improved in the city can effectively adsorb heavy metals and other substances. based on current research, we collected and obtained data from a large number of previous papers to evaluate the extent of zeolite’s effect on soil as well as plants, as scientists attempted to use zeolite to mitigate soil contamination. © 2022, polish society magnesium research. all rights reserved.",0,soil,0.8550161719322205
2022,monitoring dioxins and pcbs in eggs as sensitive indicators for environmental pollution and global contaminated sites and recommendations for reducing and controlling releases and exposure,"this review compiles information on pcdd/f- and pcb-contaminated eggs from 20 years of global egg monitoring around emission sources in four continents conducted by the international pollutants elimination network (ipen) and arnika as well as a compilation of data from scientific literature. ipen monitored 127 pooled egg samples including samples from 113 chicken flocks at potential pcdd/f- and pcb-contaminated sites around priority sources listed in the stockholm convention (e.g. waste incinerators, metal industries, cement plants, and open burning). 99 (88%) of pooled egg samples were above the eu maximum limits for pcdd/fs (2.5 pg pcdd/f-teq/g fat) or the sum of pcdd/fs and dioxin-like pcbs (5 pg pcdd/f-pcb-teq/g fat). children consuming such eggs exceed the tolerable weekly intake (twi). this demonstrates that close to 90% of these areas were not safe for the production of free-range eggs. sixteen out of the 113 egg samples (14%) were contaminated above 50 pg teq/g fat and exceeded the eu maximum limit more than 10 times. from the 26 pooled egg samples around incinerators 24 (92%) exceeded the limit with a mean of 43.1 pg teq/g fat (2.6–234 pg teq/g). all 21 egg samples around metal industries (4.4–112.6 pg teq/g fat) were above limits with mean concentration of 26.0 pg teq/g fat. also all 7 egg samples measured at e-waste recycling sites were above limits (mean 308 pg teq/g fat). in 58 (51%) pooled egg samples the pcb-teq was above 5 pg teq/g fat exceeding the eu maximum limit with dioxin-like pcbs alone. this highlights the role of commercial pcbs for global contamination with dioxin-like compounds. it was discovered that around metal industries, shredder plants, open burning sites of e-waste and dump sites, a high share of contamination was caused by dl-pcbs. this clearly shows severe pcb release from the end-of-life management of pcb-containing equipment in developing countries. also highly contaminated eggs were found at many sites where plastic was incinerated. the highest contaminated egg sample ever measured came from an e-waste site in ghana and had 856 pg teq/g fat plus 300 pg teq from brominated dioxins (pbdd/fs). other extreme pcdd/f contaminations of eggs were found at a chlor-alkali site (514 pg teq/g fat), agent orange contaminated areas in vietnam (490, 249 and 246 pg teq/g fat) and e-waste sites (568 and 520 pg teq/g fat). where dr calux® bioassay revealed higher teq compared to measured pcdd/f-pcb-teq in ipen studies, polybrominated pbdd/f were also measured and detected up to 300 pg teq/g fat at e-waste sites. one positive outcome from the ipen studies is that all 10 pooled supermarket eggs in developing countries were below regulatory limit. policy recommendations are made including: a systematic assessment of areas around pcdd/fs and pcbs sources; measures for reduction of exposures of populations; urgent control of emission sources including pcb equipment, the open burning of plastic, and the use of plastic as fuel in boilers/incinerators in developing countries without air pollution control. furthermore, soil limits need to be re-assessed and lowered for free-range poultry. © 2022 the authors","monitoring dioxins and pcbs in eggs as sensitive indicators for environmental pollution and global contaminated sites and recommendations for reducing and controlling releases and exposure this review compiles information on pcdd/f- and pcb-contaminated eggs from 20 years of global egg monitoring around emission sources in four continents conducted by the international pollutants elimination network (ipen) and arnika as well as a compilation of data from scientific literature. ipen monitored 127 pooled egg samples including samples from 113 chicken flocks at potential pcdd/f- and pcb-contaminated sites around priority sources listed in the stockholm convention (e.g. waste incinerators, metal industries, cement plants, and open burning). 99 (88%) of pooled egg samples were above the eu maximum limits for pcdd/fs (2.5 pg pcdd/f-teq/g fat) or the sum of pcdd/fs and dioxin-like pcbs (5 pg pcdd/f-pcb-teq/g fat). children consuming such eggs exceed the tolerable weekly intake (twi). this demonstrates that close to 90% of these areas were not safe for the production of free-range eggs. sixteen out of the 113 egg samples (14%) were contaminated above 50 pg teq/g fat and exceeded the eu maximum limit more than 10 times. from the 26 pooled egg samples around incinerators 24 (92%) exceeded the limit with a mean of 43.1 pg teq/g fat (2.6–234 pg teq/g). all 21 egg samples around metal industries (4.4–112.6 pg teq/g fat) were above limits with mean concentration of 26.0 pg teq/g fat. also all 7 egg samples measured at e-waste recycling sites were above limits (mean 308 pg teq/g fat). in 58 (51%) pooled egg samples the pcb-teq was above 5 pg teq/g fat exceeding the eu maximum limit with dioxin-like pcbs alone. this highlights the role of commercial pcbs for global contamination with dioxin-like compounds. it was discovered that around metal industries, shredder plants, open burning sites of e-waste and dump sites, a high share of contamination was caused by dl-pcbs. this clearly shows severe pcb release from the end-of-life management of pcb-containing equipment in developing countries. also highly contaminated eggs were found at many sites where plastic was incinerated. the highest contaminated egg sample ever measured came from an e-waste site in ghana and had 856 pg teq/g fat plus 300 pg teq from brominated dioxins (pbdd/fs). other extreme pcdd/f contaminations of eggs were found at a chlor-alkali site (514 pg teq/g fat), agent orange contaminated areas in vietnam (490, 249 and 246 pg teq/g fat) and e-waste sites (568 and 520 pg teq/g fat). where dr calux® bioassay revealed higher teq compared to measured pcdd/f-pcb-teq in ipen studies, polybrominated pbdd/f were also measured and detected up to 300 pg teq/g fat at e-waste sites. one positive outcome from the ipen studies is that all 10 pooled supermarket eggs in developing countries were below regulatory limit. policy recommendations are made including: a systematic assessment of areas around pcdd/fs and pcbs sources;

2022,cost effective soft sensing for wastewater treatment facilities,"wastewater treatment plants are complex, non-linear, engineered systems of physical, biological and chemical processes operating at different timescales. sensor systems are used to monitor wastewater treatment plants in order to ensure public safety and for efficient management of the plants. however, parameters of interest for wastewater can require expensive or inaccurate sensors or may require off-site laboratory analysis. for example, ammonium is important as a prime indicator of treatment efficiency and is highly regulated in discharge water. but ammonium sensors are also expensive at over $\$ $ 10,000 (aud) per sensor. soft sensors are computational models that accurately estimate process variables using the measurements from few physical sensors and can offer a cost-effective substitute for expensive wastewater sensors such as ammonium. in this paper, we propose a hybrid neural network architecture for learning soft sensors for complex phenomena. our network architecture fuses sequential modelling with gated recurrent neural network units (grus) to capture global trends, with convolution neural network (cnn) kernels to facilitate learning of local behaviours. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique using real-world data from a wastewater treatment plant with two-stage high-rate anaerobic and high-rate algal treatments. secondly, we propose a novel data preparation algorithm that enables the deep learning techniques to learn from a limited data and facilitates fair evaluation. we develop and learn a soft sensor to predict ammonium and study its generalization. our results demonstrate fit for purpose accuracy and that the soft sensor model is able to capture complex temporal patterns of the ground truth sensor time series. finally, we publicly release an annotated data set of a secondary wastewater treatment plant to accelerate the research in the development of soft sensors. © 2013 ieee.","cost effective soft sensing for wastewater treatment facilities wastewater treatment plants are complex, non-linear, engineered systems of physical, biological and chemical processes operating at different timescales. sensor systems are used to monitor wastewater treatment plants in order to ensure public safety and for efficient management of the plants. however, parameters of interest for wastewater can require expensive or inaccurate sensors or may require off-site laboratory analysis. for example, ammonium is important as a prime indicator of treatment efficiency and is highly regulated in discharge water. but ammonium sensors are also expensive at over $\$ $ 10,000 (aud) per sensor. soft sensors are computational models that accurately estimate process variables using the measurements from few physical sensors and can offer a cost-effective substitute for expensive wastewater sensors such as ammonium. in this paper, we propose a hybrid neural network architecture for learning soft sensors for complex phenomena. our network architecture fuses sequential modelling with gated recurrent neural network units (grus) to capture global trends, with convolution neural network (cnn) kernels to facilitate learning of local behaviours. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique using real-world data from a wastewater treatment plant with two-stage high-rate anaerobic and high-rate algal treatments. secondly, we propose a novel data preparation algorithm that enables the deep learning techniques to learn from a limited data and facilitates fair evaluation. we develop and learn a soft sensor to predict ammonium and study its generalization. our results demonstrate fit for purpose accuracy and that the soft sensor model is able to capture complex temporal patterns of the ground truth sensor time series. finally, we publicly release an annotated data set of a secondary wastewater treatment plant to accelerate the research in the development of soft sensors. © 2013 ieee.",1,water,0.8833569288253784
2022,improved native understorey establishment in mine waste rock in australia's wet-dry tropics,"re-establishment of understorey in mine waste can be challenging because of its physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics. this project investigated amelioration treatments for establishing native understorey in waste rock at ranger uranium mine, including the addition of fine sand, fertiliser, surface litter, incorporated organic matter, or a combination of sand, fertiliser and litter. trials were established in a shade house and in situ on a waste-rock landform. several grass and legume species had seedling emergence and growth being monitored. in situ, surface litter generally had twice as many seedlings emerge as did the other treatments and had the tallest mean height for most species, likely because it created a microclimate that retained moisture and moderated temperature. in the shade house, no treatment had significantly greater emergence than the control (except acacia gonocarpa f.muell. with surface litter). fertiliser application resulted in significantly taller plants in the shade house but had no effect in situ, which suggests that under well watered conditions, plant growth in waste rock is affected by nutrient deficiency, whereas in field conditions, water supply is the main growth-limiting factor. when establishing native understorey on waste rock in hot and seasonally wet-dry climates, applying surface litter with seeds may improve initial establishment. © 2022","improved native understorey establishment in mine waste rock in australia's wet-dry tropics re-establishment of understorey in mine waste can be challenging because of its physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics. this project investigated amelioration treatments for establishing native understorey in waste rock at ranger uranium mine, including the addition of fine sand, fertiliser, surface litter, incorporated organic matter, or a combination of sand, fertiliser and litter. trials were established in a shade house and in situ on a waste-rock landform. several grass and legume species had seedling emergence and growth being monitored. in situ, surface litter generally had twice as many seedlings emerge as did the other treatments and had the tallest mean height for most species, likely because it created a microclimate that retained moisture and moderated temperature. in the shade house, no treatment had significantly greater emergence than the control (except acacia gonocarpa f.muell. with surface litter). fertiliser application resulted in significantly taller plants in the shade house but had no effect in situ, which suggests that under well watered conditions, plant growth in waste rock is affected by nutrient deficiency, whereas in field conditions, water supply is the main growth-limiting factor. when establishing native understorey on waste rock in hot and seasonally wet-dry climates, applying surface litter with seeds may improve initial establishment. © 2022",1,water,0.9703871607780457
2022,vermicomposting of organic wastes by earthworms: making wealth from waste by converting ‘garbage into gold’ for farmers,"all over the world, organic wastes generated by modern human society are mounting significantly due to rising population and growing culture of consumerism. millions of tons of organic wastes (food, farm and green wastes) are ending up in the landfills every day, creating great economic and environmental problems for the local governments to manage them safely. only construction of secured waste landfills incurs $30-40 million us dollars before the first load of waste is disposed. waste disposal in the landfills costs about $65 per ton. during 2002-03, the cost of waste disposal in australia was $2458.2 million (australian bureau of statistics, 2004). organic wastes in landfills emit huge and powerful greenhouse gases (3640 mg co2-e /m2/hour) inducing global warming and climate change. they also emit some toxic gases (xylene and toluene) if they are not properly dumped and covered. waste landfills in australia emitted some 17 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2005. best solution is vermicomposting of organic wastes by waste-eater earthworms. most voracious waste-eater species of earthworms are eisenia fetida also called ‘tiger worms’, eudrilus eugeniae also called ‘african night crawler’ and perionyx excavates also called ‘indian blue worms’. vermicomposting involves about 100-1000 times higher value addition in the end-product (vermicompost - a highly nutritive organic fertilizers), converting waste into wealth for farmers. given the optimum conditions of temperature and moisture, about 1000 earthworms can vermicompost 10 kg of organic wastes or 10, 000 earthworms can vermicompost 1 ton of organic wastes in just 30 days. vermicompost gives 5-7 times higher food productivity over the conventional composts and significantly higher over the chemical fertilizers and also protect crops from pests and diseases (arancon and edwards, 2004). vermicomposting of organic wastes by earthworms will also significantly reduce emission of greenhouse gases as compared to the huge emissions from the landfills. it only emits 463 mg co2-e/m2/hour. the body fluid of earthworms termed as vermiwash, produced during vermicomposting also works as a powerful bio-pesticides. the foods produced by vermicompost are chemical-free organic foods, highly nutritious (rich in vitamins and minerals) and also health protective (due to rich in antioxidants). vermicompost also have high soil moisture holding capacity (nearly 30-40 percent) and hence also reduce the need of water for farm irrigation. huge earthworms’ biomass also comes as a valuable by-product of vermicomposting of organic wastes as the earthworms multiplies very fast doubling their population every 60-70 days. earthworms are finding many new uses in the modern world in the production of vermi-medicines to protect human beings from several diseases and also from heart diseases and cancers, protein rich vermi-meals for cattle, poultry and piggery farming increasing production of milk and meat. earthworms are also being used for production of biodegradable detergents and lubricants. they can be used for vermicomposting of more organic wastes and promotion of technologies like vermifiltration of wastewater for re-use of clean and nutritive water in farm irrigation and vermiremediation of chemically contaminated lands and soils on earth to make them usable and even fertile for farming. earthworms are blessed by nature with the capacity to detoxify and disinfect any product - solid or liquid. they also have innate defense mechanisms and strong immune system. vermicomposting is self-promoted, self-regulated, self-improved and self-enhanced, low or no-energy requiring zero-waste technology, easy to construct, operate and maintain. © 2022 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.","vermicomposting of organic wastes by earthworms: making wealth from waste by converting ‘garbage into gold’ for farmers all over the world, organic wastes generated by modern human society are mounting significantly due to rising population and growing culture of consumerism. millions of tons of organic wastes (food, farm and green wastes) are ending up in the landfills every day, creating great economic and environmental problems for the local governments to manage them safely. only construction of secured waste landfills incurs $30-40 million us dollars before the first load of waste is disposed. waste disposal in the landfills costs about $65 per ton. during 2002-03, the cost of waste disposal in australia was $2458.2 million (australian bureau of statistics, 2004). organic wastes in landfills emit huge and powerful greenhouse gases (3640 mg co2-e /m2/hour) inducing global warming and climate change. they also emit some toxic gases (xylene and toluene) if they are not properly dumped and covered. waste landfills in australia emitted some 17 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2005. best solution is vermicomposting of organic wastes by waste-eater earthworms. most voracious waste-eater species of earthworms are eisenia fetida also called ‘tiger worms’, eudrilus eugeniae also called ‘african night crawler’ and perionyx excavates also called ‘indian blue worms’. vermicomposting involves about 100-1000 times higher value addition in the end-product (vermicompost -

2022,a practical application using industrial waste for enhancing the mechanical properties of expansive soil,"in this study, a series of laboratory tests was conducted to investigate the possibility of enhancing the mechanical properties of expansive soil using bagasse fibre (bf, a waste by-product of sugar industry) integrated without or with lime stabilisation as a novel, practical application of reuse of industrial waste materials for sustainability. soil samples reinforced with three different contents of bagasse fibre ranging from 0% to 2% without or with lime combination in a range of 0–6%, were systematically prepared to assess their effect on improved engineering mechanism of expansive soil. the results revealed that bf reinforcement produced the shear strength development of reinforced soils. moreover, a lime-bf combination provided better improvement in the shrink-swell behaviour and the compressibility of reinforced soils as compared to soils treated with lime or bagasse fibre alone. the findings also indicated that adding bf into lime-soil mixtures reduced the compressible properties of lime-treated soils. meanwhile, excessively increasing bagasse fibre content greater than 1% caused a minor decrease in the compressibility improvement of reinforced soils. hence, an appropriate combination of lime and bf should be determined and used as an environmental-friendly, cost-effective and green solution for stabilisation of expansive soil to facilitate sustainable civil infrastructure development. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd.","a practical application using industrial waste for enhancing the mechanical properties of expansive soil in this study, a series of laboratory tests was conducted to investigate the possibility of enhancing the mechanical properties of expansive soil using bagasse fibre (bf, a waste by-product of sugar industry) integrated without or with lime stabilisation as a novel, practical application of reuse of industrial waste materials for sustainability. soil samples reinforced with three different contents of bagasse fibre ranging from 0% to 2% without or with lime combination in a range of 0–6%, were systematically prepared to assess their effect on improved engineering mechanism of expansive soil. the results revealed that bf reinforcement produced the shear strength development of reinforced soils. moreover, a lime-bf combination provided better improvement in the shrink-swell behaviour and the compressibility of reinforced soils as compared to soils treated with lime or bagasse fibre alone. the findings also indicated that adding bf into lime-soil mixtures reduced the compressible properties of lime-treated soils. meanwhile, excessively increasing bagasse fibre content greater than 1% caused a minor decrease in the compressibility improvement of reinforced soils. hence, an appropriate combination of lime and bf should be determined and used as an environmental-friendly, cost-effective and green solution for stabilisation of expansive soil to facilitate sustainable civil infrastructure development. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd.",0,soil,0.9846044182777405
2022,phosphorus co-existing in water: a new mechanism to boost boron removal by calcined oyster shell powder,"the removal of boron (b) from water by co-precipitation with hydroxyapatite (hap) has been extensively studied due to its low cost, ease of use and high efficiency. however, there is no explicit mechanism to express how resolved b was trapped by hap. thus, in this work, the process of removing b from water was studied using a low-cost calcium (ca) precipitation agent derived from used waste oyster shells. the results showed that the removal rate of b in the simulated wastewater by calcined oyster shell (cos) in the presence of phosphorus (p) is up to more than 90%, as opposed to virtually no removal without phosphate. for b removal, the treated water needs to be an alkaline solution with a high ph above 12, where b is removed as [cab(oh)4 ]+ but is not molecular. finally, the synergistic mechanism of co-precipitation between hap and dissolved b, occlusion co-precipitation, was explained in detail. the proposed method discovered the relationship between ca, p and b, and was aimed at removing b without secondary pollution through co-precipitation. © 2021 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.","phosphorus co-existing in water: a new mechanism to boost boron removal by calcined oyster shell powder the removal of boron (b) from water by co-precipitation with hydroxyapatite (hap) has been extensively studied due to its low cost, ease of use and high efficiency. however, there is no explicit mechanism to express how resolved b was trapped by hap. thus, in this work, the process of removing b from water was studied using a low-cost calcium (ca) precipitation agent derived from used waste oyster shells. the results showed that the removal rate of b in the simulated wastewater by calcined oyster shell (cos) in the presence of phosphorus (p) is up to more than 90%, as opposed to virtually no removal without phosphate. for b removal, the treated water needs to be an alkaline solution with a high ph above 12, where b is removed as [cab(oh)4 ]+ but is not molecular. finally, the synergistic mechanism of co-precipitation between hap and dissolved b, occlusion co-precipitation, was explained in detail. the proposed method discovered the relationship between ca, p and b, and was aimed at removing b without secondary pollution through co-precipitation. © 2021 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland.",1,water,0.8583425283432007
2022,metal and metalloid accumulation in native plants around a copper mine site: implications for phytostabilization,"mining activities can result in a pollution legacy of metal and metalloid containing soils and wastes. in this study concentrations of the metals and metalloids al, as, ca, co, cr, cu, fe, mg, mn, mo, ni, pb, zn, and the non-metals (p, s) were measured in the shoots of 35 different plant species spontaneously growing at four contaminated sites around the sungun copper mine in east azerbaijan (iran) in order to evaluate their potential in phytoremediation of this area. the results show that metal and metalloid accumulation differed between the different species. none of the plant species exceeded the relevant trace element hyperaccumulation thresholds. plant accumulation of al was found to be relatively high in achillea vermicularis (asteraceae, with up to 5,280 μg g−1) and in trifolium fragiferum (fabaceae, with up to 4,895 µg g−1). papaver dubium (papaveraceae) had relatively high foliar cu concentrations (with up to 294 µg g−1) while growing in the waste rrock dump. teucrium polium (lamiaceae) had the highest concentrations of pb (with up to 62 µg g−1). most of the native species can be classed as metal-tolerant “excluder”-type species, and may, therefore, be suitable for phytostabilization of the mining wastes around the sungun copper mine. © 2021 taylor & francis group, llc.","metal and metalloid accumulation in native plants around a copper mine site: implications for phytostabilization mining activities can result in a pollution legacy of metal and metalloid containing soils and wastes. in this study concentrations of the metals and metalloids al, as, ca, co, cr, cu, fe, mg, mn, mo, ni, pb, zn, and the non-metals (p, s) were measured in the shoots of 35 different plant species spontaneously growing at four contaminated sites around the sungun copper mine in east azerbaijan (iran) in order to evaluate their potential in phytoremediation of this area. the results show that metal and metalloid accumulation differed between the different species. none of the plant species exceeded the relevant trace element hyperaccumulation thresholds. plant accumulation of al was found to be relatively high in achillea vermicularis (asteraceae, with up to 5,280 μg g−1) and in trifolium fragiferum (fabaceae, with up to 4,895 µg g−1). papaver dubium (papaveraceae) had relatively high foliar cu concentrations (with up to 294 µg g−1) while growing in the waste rrock dump. teucrium polium (lamiaceae) had the highest concentrations of pb (with up to 62 µg g−1). most of the native species can be classed as metal-tolerant “excluder”-type species, and may, therefore, be suitable for phytostabilization of the mining wastes around the sungun copper mine. © 2021 taylor & francis group, llc.",0,soil,0.9301626682281494
2022,microwave synthesis of biochar for environmental applications,"growing environmental awareness attracted research attention to the development of efficient methods in the recycling and the recovery of wastes. microwave assisted pyrolysis (mwap) is an alternative heating approach to convert organic waste materials into value-added products, such as biochar (bc), biogas and bio-oil. different types of biochar materials have been produced through microwave heating technique that, in most of the cases, can be utilized for adsorption of organic and inorganic pollutants. the bc have been employed as co2 mitigator and fertilizer for soils due to their promising physiochemical properties. in this review paper, we discuss the various aspects of microwave assisted pyrolysis and the available case studies, as well as the mechanism of adsorption of different pollutants onto biochars. development of microwaved biochar for other applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, electrode materials, and composite membranes are also discussed. it is believed that the development and synthesis of high potential biochar through microwave assisted pyrolysis still needs very precise adjustment of processing conditions, pre-treatment of feedstock and post treatment steps for further enhancement of properties for specific applications. the paper concludes that considering the sustainable route in development of high-performance biochar would make microwave assisted pyrolysis cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and tunable materials of great potential for wide range of applications. © 2021 elsevier b.v.","microwave synthesis of biochar for environmental applications growing environmental awareness attracted research attention to the development of efficient methods in the recycling and the recovery of wastes. microwave assisted pyrolysis (mwap) is an alternative heating approach to convert organic waste materials into value-added products, such as biochar (bc), biogas and bio-oil. different types of biochar materials have been produced through microwave heating technique that, in most of the cases, can be utilized for adsorption of organic and inorganic pollutants. the bc have been employed as co2 mitigator and fertilizer for soils due to their promising physiochemical properties. in this review paper, we discuss the various aspects of microwave assisted pyrolysis and the available case studies, as well as the mechanism of adsorption of different pollutants onto biochars. development of microwaved biochar for other applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, electrode materials, and composite membranes are also discussed. it is believed that the development and synthesis of high potential biochar through microwave assisted pyrolysis still needs very precise adjustment of processing conditions, pre-treatment of feedstock and post treatment steps for further enhancement of properties for specific applications. the paper concludes that considering the sustainable route in development of high-performance biochar would make microwave assisted pyrolysis cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and tunable materials of great potential for wide range of applications. © 2021 elsevier b.v.",0,soil,0.9975689053535461

2022,variation of copper adsorption with initial ph and pyrolysis temperature by saw dust and paddy husk biochar made in an industrial type pyrolizer,"copper (ii) ions (cu2+) are one of the widely spread heavy metals in the environment causing ecological and human health risk. among the conventional methods of cu2+ removal, adsorption is observed as the most favorable. biochar, a product of pyrolysis, has a relatively structured carbon matrix with high degree of porosity and extensive surface area, like activated carbon suggesting its suitability to be used as an adsorbent material. in this study, biochar was synthesized using an industrial type pyrolyzer and low-cost agricultural waste materials; saw dust and paddy husk as feedstocks. six sets of biochar were made adhering to three temperature ranges: 350–450, 450–550 and 550–650 °c with a resident time of 30 min. further, the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of cu was tested. all the biochar materials exhibit similar trend of maximizing adsorptive removal at ph = 6. at lower ph values the surface charge of the biochar materials is positive creating unfavorable grounds for cu2+ removal. as ph increases above 6.5, cu2+ precipitates as cu(oh)2 lowering the amount of soluble cu2+ in the solution. thus, the negative adsorptive removal efficiencies can be observed at the ph values above 6. the trend followed the shape of a maximum graph for almost all biochar materials where the removal maximizes at 450–550 °c pyrolysis temperature as lower temperatures favor more functional groups while the higher temperatures favor the development of higher specific surface area. at most ph values, the saw dust biochar shows higher removal percentage compared to the paddy husk biochar. hence, a positive indication of cu removal is present at lower ph values. the kinetics follow the pseudo-second order model suggesting that chemisorption is dominant. however, isotherms of adsorption, surface characterization of the materials, tests for leaching of adsorbed pollutants must be performed before field applications are done with the developed biochar materials. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd.","variation of copper adsorption with initial ph and pyrolysis temperature by saw dust and paddy husk biochar made in an industrial type pyrolizer copper (ii) ions (cu2+) are one of the widely spread heavy metals in the environment causing ecological and human health risk. among the conventional methods of cu2+ removal, adsorption is observed as the most favorable. biochar, a product of pyrolysis, has a relatively structured carbon matrix with high degree of porosity and extensive surface area, like activated carbon suggesting its suitability to be used as an adsorbent material. in this study, biochar was synthesized using an industrial type pyrolyzer and low-cost agricultural waste materials; saw dust and paddy husk as feedstocks. six sets of biochar were made adhering to three temperature ranges: 350–450, 450–550 and 550–650 °c with a resident time of 30 min. further, the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of cu was tested. all the biochar materials exhibit similar trend of maximizing adsorptive removal at ph = 6. at lower ph values the surface charge of the biochar materials is positive creating unfavorable grounds for cu2+ removal. as ph increases above 6.5, cu2+ precipitates as cu(oh)2 lowering the amount of soluble cu2+ in the solution. thus, the negative adsorptive removal efficiencies can be observed at the ph values above 6. the trend followed the shape of a maximum graph for almost all biochar materials where the removal maximizes at 450–550 °c pyrolysis temperature as lower temperatures favor more functional groups while the higher temperatures favor the development of higher specific surface area. at most ph values, the saw dust biochar shows higher removal percentage compared to the paddy husk biochar. hence, a positive indication of cu removal is present at lower ph values. the kinetics follow the pseudo-second order model suggesting that chemisorption is dominant. however, isotherms of adsorption, surface characterization of the materials, tests for leaching of adsorbed pollutants must be performed before field applications are done with the developed biochar materials. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd.",3,metal,0.9300081133842468

2022,fifteen years of crop rotation combined with straw management alters the nitrogen supply capacity of upland-paddy soil,"straw return affects the soil n supply; however, the mechanisms underlying the effects of different straw types and substance additions on soil n availability remain elusive. this study compared net n mineralization (nnm) in soils with various straw management histories under rotations rice-fallow (rf), rice-wheat (rw) and rice-potato with straw mulch (rp) during 2003–2017. the soils were then subjected to four substrate additions, including the no-substrate control, +n [(nh4)2so4, 0.2 mg n kg−1 dry soil], +g (glucose, 0.6 mg c kg−1 dry soil) and +g+n (both). the responses of the soil nnm to substrate additions varied depending on the soils’ different straw histories. the direction of nnm was affected by substrate addition, but the magnitude depended on crop rotation and straw management. the nnm in the +g treatment ranged from 15.5 to 71.5 mg kg−1 in the soils with various straw histories, with rw and rp having 299% and 366% greater nnm than rf, respectively. conversely, the addition of +n and +g+n decreased the soil nnm significantly in the soil with rw and rp straw histories, being 70~75% and 28~39% lower in the +n and +g+n treatments, respectively, than in the soil without straw history (rf). in addition, long-term straw return (rp and rw) significantly increased the soil ammonium n, amino acid n, and microbial biomass c and extracellular enzyme activity, while the addition of n and c substrates altered the decomposition of soil organic n. the long-term straw history also affected the soil bacterial community and formed a significant grouping compared to rf. in general, the soil from rf was dominated by heterotrophic bacteria such as actinobacteria, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria, while the soils of rp and rw were mainly firmicutes involved in straw glycolysis and part of proteobacteria involved in n metabolism. adding inorganic n altered bacteria in proteobacteria, and the relative abundance of proteobacteria had a negative relationship with the concentration of available n, indicating that bacteria induced by exogenous n were not involved in inherent n mineralization in soil. the addition of glucose enhanced the bacterial communities involved in n mineralization. the results imply that the soil n supply capability was enhanced with straw history under n deficiency and that an excess supply of n fertilizers was immobilized to minimize leaching losses. © 2021 elsevier b.v.","fifteen years of crop rotation combined with straw management alters the nitrogen supply capacity of upland-paddy soil straw return affects the soil n supply;

2022,antimony contamination and its risk management in complex environmental settings: a review,"antimony (sb) is introduced into soils, sediments, and aquatic environments from various sources such as weathering of sulfide ores, leaching of mining wastes, and anthropogenic activities. high sb concentrations are toxic to ecosystems and potentially to public health via the accumulation in food chain. although sb is poisonous and carcinogenic to humans, the exact mechanisms causing toxicity still remain unclear. most studies concerning the remediation of soils and aquatic environments contaminated with sb have evaluated various amendments that reduce sb bioavailability and toxicity. however, there is no comprehensive review on the biogeochemistry and transformation of sb related to its remediation. therefore, the present review summarizes: (1) the sources of sb and its geochemical distribution and speciation in soils and aquatic environments, (2) the biogeochemical processes that govern sb mobilization, bioavailability, toxicity in soils and aquatic environments, and possible threats to human and ecosystem health, and (3) the approaches used to remediate sb-contaminated soils and water and mitigate potential environmental and health risks. knowledge gaps and future research needs also are discussed. the review presents up-to-date knowledge about the fate of sb in soils and aquatic environments and contributes to an important insight into the environmental hazards of sb. the findings from the review should help to develop innovative and appropriate technologies for controlling sb bioavailability and toxicity and sustainably managing sb-polluted soils and water, subsequently minimizing its environmental and human health risks. © 2021 the author(s)","antimony contamination and its risk management in complex environmental settings: a review antimony (sb) is introduced into soils, sediments, and aquatic environments from various sources such as weathering of sulfide ores, leaching of mining wastes, and anthropogenic activities. high sb concentrations are toxic to ecosystems and potentially to public health via the accumulation in food chain. although sb is poisonous and carcinogenic to humans, the exact mechanisms causing toxicity still remain unclear. most studies concerning the remediation of soils and aquatic environments contaminated with sb have evaluated various amendments that reduce sb bioavailability and toxicity. however, there is no comprehensive review on the biogeochemistry and transformation of sb related to its remediation. therefore, the present review summarizes: (1) the sources of sb and its geochemical distribution and speciation in soils and aquatic environments, (2) the biogeochemical processes that govern sb mobilization, bioavailability, toxicity in soils and aquatic environments, and possible threats to human and ecosystem health, and (3) the approaches used to remediate sb-contaminated soils and water and mitigate potential environmental and health risks. knowledge gaps and future research needs also are discussed. the review presents up-to-date knowledge about the fate of sb in soils and aquatic environments and contributes to an important insight into the environmental hazards of sb. the findings from the review should help to develop innovative and appropriate technologies for controlling sb bioavailability and toxicity and sustainably managing sb-polluted soils and water, subsequently minimizing its environmental and human health risks. © 2021 the author(s)",0,soil,0.9872822165489197
2022,utilization of coal fly ash waste for effective recapture of phosphorus from waters,"reutilization of the waste by-products from industrial and agricultural activities is crucially important towards attainment of environmental sustainability and the ‘circular economy’. in this study, we have developed and evaluated a sustainably-sourced adsorbent from coal fly ash, which was modified by a small amount of lanthanum (la-fa), for the recapture of phosphorous (p) from both synthetic and real natural waters. the prepared la-fa adsorbent possessed typical characteristic diffraction peaks similar to zeolite type na–p1, and the bet surface area of la-fa was measured to be 10.9 times higher than that of the original fa. investigation of p adsorption capability indicated that the maximum adsorption (10.8 mg p g−1) was 6.14 times higher than that (1.8 mg p g−1) of the original fly ash material. the ζ potentials measurement and p k-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (xanes) spectra demonstrated that p was bonded on la-fa surfaces via an adsorption mechanism. after applying the proposed adsorbent to real lake water with la/p molar ratios in the range from 0.5:1 to 3:1, the la-fa adsorbent showed the highest phosphate removal ability with a la/p molar ratio 1:1, and the p adsorption was similar to that performance with the synthetic solution. moreover, the la-fa absorbent produced a negligible effect on the concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (tdn), nh4+-n and no3−-n in water. this study thus provides a potential material for effective p recapture and details of its operation. © 2021 elsevier ltd","utilization of coal fly ash waste for effective recapture of phosphorus from waters reutilization of the waste by-products from industrial and agricultural activities is crucially important towards attainment of environmental sustainability and the ‘circular economy’. in this study, we have developed and evaluated a sustainably-sourced adsorbent from coal fly ash, which was modified by a small amount of lanthanum (la-fa), for the recapture of phosphorous (p) from both synthetic and real natural waters. the prepared la-fa adsorbent possessed typical characteristic diffraction peaks similar to zeolite type na–p1, and the bet surface area of la-fa was measured to be 10.9 times higher than that of the original fa. investigation of p adsorption capability indicated that the maximum adsorption (10.8 mg p g−1) was 6.14 times higher than that (1.8 mg p g−1) of the original fly ash material. the ζ potentials measurement and p k-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (xanes) spectra demonstrated that p was bonded on la-fa surfaces via an adsorption mechanism. after applying the proposed adsorbent to real lake water with la/p molar ratios in the range from 0.5:1 to 3:1, the la-fa adsorbent showed the highest phosphate removal ability with a la/p molar ratio 1:1, and the p adsorption was similar to that performance with the synthetic solution. moreover, the la-fa absorbent produced a negligible effect on the concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (tdn), nh4+-n and no3−-n in water. this study thus provides a potential material for effective p recapture and details of its operation. © 2021 elsevier ltd",1,water,0.9266853928565979

2022,"sars-cov-2 and other pathogens in municipal wastewater, landfill leachate, and solid waste: a review about virus surveillance, infectivity, and inactivation","this review discusses the techniques available for detecting and inactivating of pathogens in municipal wastewater, landfill leachate, and solid waste. in view of the current covid-19 pandemic, sars-cov-2 is being given special attention, with a thorough examination of all possible transmission pathways linked to the selected waste matrices. despite the lack of works focused on landfill leachate, a systematic review method, based on cluster analysis, allows to analyze the available papers devoted to sewage sludge and wastewater, allowing to focalize the work on technologies able to detect and treat pathogens. in this work, great attention is also devoted to infectivity and transmission mechanisms of sars-cov-2. moreover, the literature analysis shows that sewage sludge and landfill leachate seem to have a remote chance to act as a virus transmission route (pollution-to-human transmission) due to improper collection and treatment of municipal wastewater and solid waste. however due to the incertitude about virus infectivity, these possibilities cannot be excluded and need further investigation. as a conclusion, this paper shows that additional research is required not only on the coronavirus-specific disinfection, but also the regular surveillance or monitoring of viral loads in sewage sludge, wastewater, and landfill leachate. the disinfection strategies need to be optimized in terms of dosage and potential adverse impacts like antimicrobial resistance, among many other factors. finally, the presence of sars-cov-2 and other pathogenic microorganisms in sewage sludge, wastewater, and landfill leachate can hamper the possibility to ensure safe water and public health in economically marginalized countries and hinder the realization of the united nations' sustainable development goals (sdgs). © 2021 elsevier inc.","sars-cov-2 and other pathogens in municipal wastewater, landfill leachate, and solid waste: a review about virus surveillance, infectivity, and inactivation this review discusses the techniques available for detecting and inactivating of pathogens in municipal wastewater, landfill leachate, and solid waste. in view of the current covid-19 pandemic, sars-cov-2 is being given special attention, with a thorough examination of all possible transmission pathways linked to the selected waste matrices. despite the lack of works focused on landfill leachate, a systematic review method, based on cluster analysis, allows to analyze the available papers devoted to sewage sludge and wastewater, allowing to focalize the work on technologies able to detect and treat pathogens. in this work, great attention is also devoted to infectivity and transmission mechanisms of sars-cov-2. moreover, the literature analysis shows that sewage sludge and landfill leachate seem to have a remote chance to act as a virus transmission route (pollution-to-human transmission) due to improper collection and treatment of municipal wastewater and solid waste. however due to the incertitude about virus infectivity, these possibilities cannot be excluded and need further investigation. as a conclusion, this paper shows that additional research is required not only on the coronavirus-specific disinfection, but also the regular surveillance or monitoring of viral loads in sewage sludge, wastewater, and landfill leachate. the disinfection strategies need to be optimized in terms of dosage and potential adverse impacts like antimicrobial resistance, among many other factors. finally, the presence of sars-cov-2 and other pathogenic microorganisms in sewage sludge, wastewater, and landfill leachate can hamper the possibility to ensure safe water and public health in economically marginalized countries and hinder the realization of the united nations' sustainable development goals (sdgs). © 2021 elsevier inc.",1,water,0.9368884563446045

2022,nanomaterials for sustainable remediation of chemical contaminants in water and soil,"rapid growth in population, industry, urbanization and intensive agriculture have led to soil and water pollution by various contaminants. nanoremediation has become one of the most successful emerging technologies for cleaning up soil and water contaminants due to the high reactivity of nanomaterials (nms). numerous publications are available on the use of nms for removing contaminants, and the efficiencies are often improved by modifications of nms with polymers, clay minerals, zeolites, activated carbon, and biochar. this paper critically reviews the current state-of-the-art nms used for sustainable soil and water remediation, focusing on their applications in novel remedial approaches, such as adsorption/filtration, catalysis, photodegradation, electro-nanoremediation, and nano-bioremediation. insights into process performances, modes of deployment, potential environmental risks and their management, and the consequent societal and economic implications of using nms for soil and water remediation indicate that widespread acceptance of nanoremediation technologies requires not only a substantial advancement of the underpinning science and engineering aspects themselves, but also practical demonstrations of the effectiveness of already recognized approaches at real world in-situ conditions. new research involving green nanotechnology, nano-bioremediation, electro-nanoremediation, risk assessment of nms, and outreach activities are needed to achieve successful applications of nanoremediation at regional and global scales. © 2021 taylor & francis group, llc.","nanomaterials for sustainable remediation of chemical contaminants in water and soil rapid growth in population, industry, urbanization and intensive agriculture have led to soil and water pollution by various contaminants. nanoremediation has become one of the most successful emerging technologies for cleaning up soil and water contaminants due to the high reactivity of nanomaterials (nms). numerous publications are available on the use of nms for removing contaminants, and the efficiencies are often improved by modifications of nms with polymers, clay minerals, zeolites, activated carbon, and biochar. this paper critically reviews the current state-of-the-art nms used for sustainable soil and water remediation, focusing on their applications in novel remedial approaches, such as adsorption/filtration, catalysis, photodegradation, electro-nanoremediation, and nano-bioremediation. insights into process performances, modes of deployment, potential environmental risks and their management, and the consequent societal and economic implications of using nms for soil and water remediation indicate that widespread acceptance of nanoremediation technologies requires not only a substantial advancement of the underpinning science and engineering aspects themselves, but also practical demonstrations of the effectiveness of already recognized approaches at real world in-situ conditions. new research involving green nanotechnology, nano-bioremediation, electro-nanoremediation, risk assessment of nms, and outreach activities are needed to achieve successful applications of nanoremediation at regional and global scales. © 2021 taylor & francis group, llc.",0,soil,0.9762855768203735
2022,evaluation of volumetric performance of asphalt mixtures containing recycled construction aggregate (rca),"high rate of construction and demolition waste materials results in a large amount of stockpiled waste materials. pavement industry is now considering a sustainable approach for asphalt mixture design incorporating certain waste materials. this research investigates the feasibility of substitution of virgin aggregates in asphalt mixes with recycled construction aggregates (rca) obtained from the construction and demolition sector. a preliminary experimental study including determination of flakiness index, particle shape, wet/dry strength variation, water absorption rate, particle density, crushing value, deleterious material and weak particles was conducted on blends of rca and virgin aggregates to evaluate the engineering properties of aggregate blends. different asphalt mixes incorporating rca at different rates were prepared and evaluated using a gyratory compaction. the results of the regression analysis showed that the asphalt mixtures containing 20% to 22% rca provide comparable volumetric properties as the control sample, while mixes with higher rca substitutions achieved higher air voids, and lower voids in the mineral aggregate (vma), voids filled with asphalt (vfa) and binder film index (bfi). the results of this study suggested a feasible use of rca for partial aggregate replacement in hot mix asphalt (hma). © 2020 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group.","evaluation of volumetric performance of asphalt mixtures containing recycled construction aggregate (rca) high rate of construction and demolition waste materials results in a large amount of stockpiled waste materials. pavement industry is now considering a sustainable approach for asphalt mixture design incorporating certain waste materials. this research investigates the feasibility of substitution of virgin aggregates in asphalt mixes with recycled construction aggregates (rca) obtained from the construction and demolition sector. a preliminary experimental study including determination of flakiness index, particle shape, wet/dry strength variation, water absorption rate, particle density, crushing value, deleterious material and weak particles was conducted on blends of rca and virgin aggregates to evaluate the engineering properties of aggregate blends. different asphalt mixes incorporating rca at different rates were prepared and evaluated using a gyratory compaction. the results of the regression analysis showed that the asphalt mixtures containing 20% to 22% rca provide comparable volumetric properties as the control sample, while mixes with higher rca substitutions achieved higher air voids, and lower voids in the mineral aggregate (vma), voids filled with asphalt (vfa) and binder film index (bfi). the results of this study suggested a feasible use of rca for partial aggregate replacement in hot mix asphalt (hma). © 2020 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group.",2,air,0.8260523080825806
