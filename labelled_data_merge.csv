the preparation of paddy soil amendment using granite and marble waste: performance and mechanisms,"the wastes generated from the mining and processing of granite and marble stone are generally regarded as useless. however, these waste materials were used as the soil amendments for the first time. the functional groups, crystalline structure and micro-morphology of granite and marble wastes amendments (gmwa) were different from the original wastes demonstrated by x-ray diffractometer (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ft-ir) and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (sem-eds) analyses. with the addition of the amendments, the cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity and nutrient availability of the soil increased, and the extractable heavy metals of the soil reduced significantly. under the condition of the addition of 3% amendments, 7.0%, 99.9%, 99.7% and 70.5% of cu, pb, zn and cd in exchangeable fractions in soil were transformed to the more stable fe-mn oxides- or carbonates-bounded fractions. tessier method and correlation analysis showed that the reduction of extractable metals in the acidic paddy soil can be attributed to the adsorption of available sio2, the co-precipitation induced by the elevated ph value, the complexation induced by fe-mn oxides and the cation exchange induced by mineral nutrients. this study provides a new strategy for resource recovery of waste stones and remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil. © 2022",soil,0,"the preparation of paddy soil amendment using granite and marble waste: performance and mechanisms the wastes generated from the mining and processing of granite and marble stone are generally regarded as useless. however, these waste materials were used as the soil amendments for the first time. the functional groups, crystalline structure and micro-morphology of granite and marble wastes amendments (gmwa) were different from the original wastes demonstrated by x-ray diffractometer (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ft-ir) and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (sem-eds) analyses. with the addition of the amendments, the cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity and nutrient availability of the soil increased, and the extractable heavy metals of the soil reduced significantly. under the condition of the addition of 3% amendments, 7.0%, 99.9%, 99.7% and 70.5% of cu, pb, zn and cd in exchangeable fractions in soil were transformed to the more stable fe-mn oxides- or carbonates-bounded fractions. tessier method and correlation analysis showed that the reduction of extractable metals in the acidic paddy soil can be attributed to the adsorption of available sio2, the co-precipitation induced by the elevated ph value, the complexation induced by fe-mn oxides and the cation exchange induced by mineral nutrients. this study provides a new strategy for resource recovery of waste stones and remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil. © 2022"
heavy metal pollution risk of desulfurized steel slag as a soil amendment in cycling use of solid wastes,"the by-product of wet flue gas desulfurization, desulfurized steel slag (ds), had chemical characteristics like natural gypsum that can be used to improve saline-sodic soil. however, contamination risk of heavy metals for cycling utilization of ds in agriculture was concerned mostly. both pot and field experiments were conducted for evaluating the potential pollution risk of ds as the amendment of saline-sodic soil. results showed that application of ds decreased the contents of cd, cu, zn, and pb, while significantly increasing chromium (cr) content in ds-amended soils. the field experiment demonstrated that the migration of heavy metals (cd, zn, cu, and pb) in the soil profile was negligible. the application of ds at the dosage of 22.5–225 tons/ha significantly increased the cr content in alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) but lower than the national standard for feed in china (gb 13078-2017). ds altered the chemical fraction of heavy metals (zn, cu, and pb), transferred exchangeable, reducible into oxidizable and residual forms in ds-amended soil. application of ds combined with fulvic acid (fa) could effectively reduce the movement of heavy metals in soil and the accumulation of cr in alfalfa. based on our results, ds was a safe and feasible material for agricultural use and presented relatively little pollution risk of heavy metals. however, the results also showed that ds to a certain extent had a potential environmental risk of cr if larger dosages of ds were used. © 2022",soil,0,"heavy metal pollution risk of desulfurized steel slag as a soil amendment in cycling use of solid wastes the by-product of wet flue gas desulfurization, desulfurized steel slag (ds), had chemical characteristics like natural gypsum that can be used to improve saline-sodic soil. however, contamination risk of heavy metals for cycling utilization of ds in agriculture was concerned mostly. both pot and field experiments were conducted for evaluating the potential pollution risk of ds as the amendment of saline-sodic soil. results showed that application of ds decreased the contents of cd, cu, zn, and pb, while significantly increasing chromium (cr) content in ds-amended soils. the field experiment demonstrated that the migration of heavy metals (cd, zn, cu, and pb) in the soil profile was negligible. the application of ds at the dosage of 22.5–225 tons/ha significantly increased the cr content in alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) but lower than the national standard for feed in china (gb 13078-2017). ds altered the chemical fraction of heavy metals (zn, cu, and pb), transferred exchangeable, reducible into oxidizable and residual forms in ds-amended soil. application of ds combined with fulvic acid (fa) could effectively reduce the movement of heavy metals in soil and the accumulation of cr in alfalfa. based on our results, ds was a safe and feasible material for agricultural use and presented relatively little pollution risk of heavy metals. however, the results also showed that ds to a certain extent had a potential environmental risk of cr if larger dosages of ds were used. © 2022"
heavy metals concentration in the sediment of the aquaticenvironment caused by the leachate discharge from a landfill,"background and objectives: heavy metals are categorized as hazardous pollutants due to their incapability in decomposing and undergoing bioaccumulation and biomagnification. heavy metal pollution is a global issue, particularly in emerging nations such as indonesia. in this case, sediments contribute to pollution dispersion because they can transport, mobilize, and redistribute toxic compounds. the cisadane river is one of 15 watersheds in indonesia with the highest restoration priority. therefore, it is essential to conduct study on the sediment quality of this river. this investigation aimed to evaluate the levels of cadmium, chromium, and lead in the sediments to assess the conditions of the cisadane river. methods: at eight stations (representing the midstream and downstream region), surface sediment samples were collected using a van veen sediment grab based on the hypothesis that heavy metal pollution originated from land-based activities and migrated down river estuaries. the thermo scientific icap 7400 was utilized to assess heavy metals (cadmium, chromium, and lead) by adopting prior research methodologies and method guidelines. findings: except for lead, which surpassed the interim sediment quality standard, the levels of heavy metals observed in the midstream and downstream sections of the cisadane river were found to be well below the guideline level. in this case, lead was the metal with the highest concentration in the sediments of the cisadane river, followed by chromium and cadmium. the enrichment of heavy metals in river sediments was most likely caused by soil leaching, municipal and industrial sewage, as well as land waste disposal. after the landfill area, there were two areas with the highest concentration. therefore, this investigation indicated the existence of landfills as point sources of heavy metals. regarding specifics, two sites following the landfill constitute the apex of heavy metal amplification. conclusion: this analysis shows that the sediment’s cadmium, chromium, and lead contents are below the standards’ threshold and safe for the habitat. cadmium, chromium and lead exceed sediment quality requirements in sample sites after landfills, assumed to be due to leachate discharge and landfill activities. this study further also reveals that landfills are point sources of heavy metals. in this case, the heavy metals are two to four times higher in one kilometer from the landfill’s leachate discharge. therefore, the enforcement of the indonesia waste law number 18 year 2008 would have replaced unsanitary dumping including implementation of physicochemical, biological, and combination remediation techniques, with a vastly superior waste management system. © 2023 the author(s). this article is licensed under a creative commons attribution 4.0 international license,

"occurrence, spatial distribution and ecological risks of antibiotics in soil in urban agglomeration","antibiotics in soil environment are regarded as emerging pollutants and have introduced increasing risks to soil ecosystem and human health in rapid urbanization areas. identifying the occurrence and spatial variability of antibiotics in soils is an urgent issue in sustaining soil security. in this study, antibiotics in soils were investigated and analyzed in beijing-tianjin-hebei urban agglomeration. the occurrence, spatial distribution, and related affecting factors of antibiotics in soils were identified and ecological risks of antibiotics in soil environment were assessed. results showed that (1) the mean concentration of soil antibiotics in beijing-tianjin-hebei urban agglomeration was 21.79 μg/kg. land use substantially affected the occurrence and concentration of antibiotics in soils. concentrations of antibiotics in cropland and orchard soils were 2-3 times higher than the other land use types. (2) the concentrations of antibiotics in soils in beijing-tianjin-hebei urban agglomeration presented a spatial pattern of high values in southeast, and low values in northwest. spatial variability of antibiotics in soils was closely related to the application of organic fertilizer and wastewater irrigation as well as topographical features. furthermore, soil properties and land management policy had substantial influences on soil antibiotics, and soil heavy metals may aggravate the accumulation of antibiotics in soils. (3) ecological risks assessment of antibiotics in soils demonstrated that erythromycin (ery), sulfamethoxazole (smx), and doxycycline (dox) may introduce high risks to soil ecosystem health, and more attention should be paid to the areas with intensive human activities that had potential high risk to soil ecosystem health. this study suggests that scientific land and soil management should be considered to prevent soil antibiotic pollution and sustain soil security in urban agglomeration. © 2022",soil,0,"occurrence, spatial distribution and ecological risks of antibiotics in soil in urban agglomeration antibiotics in soil environment are regarded as emerging pollutants and have introduced increasing risks to soil ecosystem and human health in rapid urbanization areas. identifying the occurrence and spatial variability of antibiotics in soils is an urgent issue in sustaining soil security. in this study, antibiotics in soils were investigated and analyzed in beijing-tianjin-hebei urban agglomeration. the occurrence, spatial distribution, and related affecting factors of antibiotics in soils were identified and ecological risks of antibiotics in soil environment were assessed. results showed that (1) the mean concentration of soil antibiotics in beijing-tianjin-hebei urban agglomeration was 21.79 μg/kg. land use substantially affected the occurrence and concentration of antibiotics in soils. concentrations of antibiotics in cropland and orchard soils were 2-3 times higher than the other land use types.

remediation performance and mechanisms of cu and cd contaminated water and soil using mn/al-layered double oxide-loaded biochar,"the combined pollution of heavy metals is ubiquitous worldwide. mn/al-layered double oxide-loaded crab shells biochar (ldo/bc) was prepared, so as to remediate the combined pollution of cd and cu in soil and water. the pristine and used ldo/bc were characterized and the results revealed that the layered double oxide was successfully loaded on crab shells biochar (bc) and metal element ca in crab shells was beneficial to the formation of more regular layered and flake structure. the maximal adsorption capacity (qm) of ldo/bc for aqueous cu2+ and cd2+ was 66.23 and 73.47 mg/g, respectively. ldo/bc and bc were used to remediate e-waste-contaminated soil for the first time and exhibited highly efficient performance. the extraction amount of cu and cd in the contaminated soil by diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (dtpa) after treating with 5% ldo/bc was significantly reduced from 819.84 to 205.95 mg/kg (with passivation rate 74.8%) and 8.46 to 4.16 mg/kg (with passivation rate 50.8%), respectively, inferring that the bioavailability of heavy metals declined remarkably. the experimental result also suggested that after remediation by ldo/bc the exchangeable and weak acid soluble cu and cd in soil translated to reducible, residual and oxidizable fraction which are more stable state. precipitation, complexation and ion exchange were proposed as the possible mechanisms for cd and cu removal. in general, these experiment results indicate that ldo/bc can be a potentially effective reagent for remediation of heavy metal contaminated water and soil. © 2022",soil,0,"remediation performance and mechanisms of cu and cd contaminated water and soil using mn/al-layered double oxide-loaded biochar the combined pollution of heavy metals is ubiquitous worldwide. mn/al-layered double oxide-loaded crab shells biochar (ldo/bc) was prepared, so as to remediate the combined pollution of cd and cu in soil and water. the pristine and used ldo/bc were characterized and the results revealed that the layered double oxide was successfully loaded on crab shells biochar (bc) and metal element ca in crab shells was beneficial to the formation of more regular layered and flake structure. the maximal adsorption capacity (qm) of ldo/bc for aqueous cu2+ and cd2+ was 66.23 and 73.47 mg/g, respectively. ldo/bc and bc were used to remediate e-waste-contaminated soil for the first time and exhibited highly efficient performance. the extraction amount of cu and cd in the contaminated soil by diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (dtpa) after treating with 5% ldo/bc was significantly reduced from 819.84 to 205.95 mg/kg (with passivation rate 74.8%) and 8.46 to 4.16 mg/kg (with passivation rate 50.8%), respectively, inferring that the bioavailability of heavy metals declined remarkably. the experimental result also suggested that after remediation by ldo/bc the exchangeable and weak acid soluble cu and cd in soil translated to reducible, residual and oxidizable fraction which are more stable state. precipitation, complexation and ion exchange were proposed as the possible mechanisms for cd and cu removal. in general, these experiment results indicate that ldo/bc can be a potentially effective reagent for remediation of heavy metal contaminated water and soil. © 2022"
depth-dependent patterns of soil microbial community in the e-waste dismantling area,"the long-term dismantling of electronic waste (e-waste) has contaminated the soil environment considerably. in spite of this, it is unknown if it affects the depth-resolved microbial communities. in the present research, six soil profiles (dismantling sites and the surrounding farmland) were collected from one of the largest chinese e-waste disposal centers to identify depth-resolved microbiota and assess how heavy metal contamination affects microbial adaptation. results suggested that cadmium (0.12–7.22 mg kg−1) and copper (18.99–11282.03 mg kg−1) were the main pollutants in the test soil profiles, and their concentrations gradually decreased with depth. the surrounding contaminated farmland has a more complex interaction and higher modularity (0.77–0.85) among microbes, indicating a stronger niche differentiation to enhance functional diversity. the proportion of positive interactions between taxa decreased with depth, as high heavy metals contamination in the topsoil results in the co-occurrence of microorganisms with the same ecological niche that collaborated to face environmental stress. soil physicochemical properties, heavy metals concentration, and soil depth critically affect microbial communities. microbial community assembly processes in the topsoil were affected by environmental filtering, i.e., by deterministic processes (nst: 13–52%), while were more stochastic (nst: 46–72%) in the subsoil due to the environment of soil becoming more homogeneous as soil depth increased. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",soil,0,"depth-dependent patterns of soil microbial community in the e-waste dismantling area the long-term dismantling of electronic waste (e-waste) has contaminated the soil environment considerably. in spite of this, it is unknown if it affects the depth-resolved microbial communities. in the present research, six soil profiles (dismantling sites and the surrounding farmland) were collected from one of the largest chinese e-waste disposal centers to identify depth-resolved microbiota and assess how heavy metal contamination affects microbial adaptation. results suggested that cadmium (0.12–7.22 mg kg−1) and copper (18.99–11282.03 mg kg−1) were the main pollutants in the test soil profiles, and their concentrations gradually decreased with depth. the surrounding contaminated farmland has a more complex interaction and higher modularity (0.77–0.85) among microbes, indicating a stronger niche differentiation to enhance functional diversity. the proportion of positive interactions between taxa decreased with depth, as high heavy metals contamination in the topsoil results in the co-occurrence of microorganisms with the same ecological niche that collaborated to face environmental stress. soil physicochemical properties, heavy metals concentration, and soil depth critically affect microbial communities. microbial community assembly processes in the topsoil were affected by environmental filtering, i.e., by deterministic processes (nst: 13–52%), while were more stochastic (nst: 46–72%) in the subsoil due to the environment of soil becoming more homogeneous as soil depth increased. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
heterogeneous distributions of heavy metals in the soil-groundwater system empowers the knowledge of the pollution migration at a smelting site,"heavy metal contaminations of soil-groundwater systems from smelting activities is a widespread problem affecting >30 % of industrial lands worldwide. contaminants from the soil migrate into the groundwater and spread further into the surrounding area, causing persistent hazards to human health and the environment. in the present study, migration behaviors and patterns of four persistent pollutants—cadmium (cd), zinc (zn), lead (pb) and arsenic (as)—in a soil-groundwater system were investigated through their heterogeneous distribution characteristics. the results show that these heavy metals (hm) migrate in the vadose zone vertically downwards by gravity while in the saturated aquifer, migration patterns were more probably dominated by solute transport due to groundwater flow. in addition, the migration potential of hms based on their speciation was ranked as cd > zn > pb > as, which equally reflected their associated environmental risks. correlation analysis suggested that external pollutant input and hydrogeological characteristics are the main factors controlling the migration and transformation of hms. the original form of hms in smelting waste slag determines the release rate. moreover, partitioning of hms with the exchangeable phase was closely related to the formation, distribution and extent of groundwater pollution. the migration behaviors and patterns of hms in the soil-groundwater system of a smelting site were confirmed for the first time through field tests, which could provide valuable insights into contaminant transport and potential barrier control interventions at polluted sites. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",soil,0,"heterogeneous distributions of heavy metals in the soil-groundwater system empowers the knowledge of the pollution migration at a smelting site heavy metal contaminations of soil-groundwater systems from smelting activities is a widespread problem affecting >30 % of industrial lands worldwide. contaminants from the soil migrate into the groundwater and spread further into the surrounding area, causing persistent hazards to human health and the environment. in the present study, migration behaviors and patterns of four persistent pollutants—cadmium (cd), zinc (zn), lead (pb) and arsenic (as)—in a soil-groundwater system were investigated through their heterogeneous distribution characteristics. the results show that these heavy metals (hm) migrate in the vadose zone vertically downwards by gravity while in the saturated aquifer, migration patterns were more probably dominated by solute transport due to groundwater flow. in addition, the migration potential of hms based on their speciation was ranked as cd > zn > pb > as, which equally reflected their associated environmental risks. correlation analysis suggested that external pollutant input and hydrogeological characteristics are the main factors controlling the migration and transformation of hms. the original form of hms in smelting waste slag determines the release rate. moreover, partitioning of hms with the exchangeable phase was closely related to the formation, distribution and extent of groundwater pollution. the migration behaviors and patterns of hms in the soil-groundwater system of a smelting site were confirmed for the first time through field tests, which could provide valuable insights into contaminant transport and potential barrier control interventions at polluted sites. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
synergy of directional oxidation and vacuum gasification for green recovery of as2o3 from arsenic-containing hazardous secondary resources,"arsenic, a hazardous material that is toxic for humans, enters the human body through soil, water, and air. furthermore, metal smelting is known to produce arsenic-containing hazardous secondary resources (ahsrs), which cause irreversible damage to the total environment. therefore, a novel, clean, and efficient arsenic fixation technology has been developed in this study for arsenic removal, which involves directional oxidation and vacuum gasification of ahsrs. oxidation results revealed that physical phases containing arsenic (as, as2o3, as2te3 and cu3as) are selectively oxidized to as2o3 completely and thus classified as oxidative modulation products (omps). meanwhile, approximately 98.82% as2o3 of omps convert into volatiles in the following gasification. characterization results showed that as2o3 with 96.72% purity and uniform microscopic distribution was obtained in the form of monoclinic crystalline needle-like crystals. the proposed approach organically combines oxidation and volatilization properties of each element to facilitate clean and efficient separation as well as recovery of as2o3. no hazardous gas or wastewater is discharged during the entire process, thereby ensuring that arsenic is recycled in a sustainable and clean manner. overall, this study provides a clean and low-carbon approach for recycling secondary resources containing arsenic. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",soil,0,"synergy of directional oxidation and vacuum gasification for green recovery of as2o3 from arsenic-containing hazardous secondary resources arsenic, a hazardous material that is toxic for humans, enters the human body through soil, water, and air. furthermore, metal smelting is known to produce arsenic-containing hazardous secondary resources (ahsrs), which cause irreversible damage to the total environment. therefore, a novel, clean, and efficient arsenic fixation technology has been developed in this study for arsenic removal, which involves directional oxidation and vacuum gasification of ahsrs. oxidation results revealed that physical phases containing arsenic (as, as2o3, as2te3 and cu3as) are selectively oxidized to as2o3 completely and thus classified as oxidative modulation products (omps). meanwhile, approximately 98.82% as2o3 of omps convert into volatiles in the following gasification. characterization results showed that as2o3 with 96.72% purity and uniform microscopic distribution was obtained in the form of monoclinic crystalline needle-like crystals. the proposed approach organically combines oxidation and volatilization properties of each element to facilitate clean and efficient separation as well as recovery of as2o3. no hazardous gas or wastewater is discharged during the entire process, thereby ensuring that arsenic is recycled in a sustainable and clean manner. overall, this study provides a clean and low-carbon approach for recycling secondary resources containing arsenic. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
a review of microbial degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas): biotransformation routes and enzymes,"since the 1950s, copious amounts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) (dubbed “forever chemicals”) have been dumped into the environment, causing heavy contamination of soil, surface water, and groundwater sources. humans, animals, and the environment are frequently exposed to pfas through food, water, consumer products, as well as waste streams from pfas-manufacturing industries. pfas are a large group of synthetic organic fluorinated compounds with widely diverse chemical structures that are extremely resistant to microbial degradation. their persistence, toxicity to life on earth, bioaccumulation tendencies, and adverse health and ecological effects have earned them a “top priority pollutant” designation by regulatory bodies. despite that a number of physicochemical methods exist for pfas treatment, they suffer from major drawbacks regarding high costs, use of high energy and incomplete mineralization (destruction of the c[sbnd]f bond). consequently, microbial degradation and enzymatic treatment of pfas are highly sought after as they offer a complete, cheaper, sustainable, and environmentally friendly alternative. in this critical review, we provide an overview of the classification, properties, and interaction of pfas within the environment relevant to microbial degradation. we discuss latest developments in the biodegradation of pfas by microbes, transformation routes, transformation products and degradative enzymes. finally, we highlight the existing challenges, limitations, and prospects of bioremediation approaches in treating pfas and proffer possible solutions and future research directions. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",soil,0,"a review of microbial degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas): biotransformation routes and enzymes since the 1950s, copious amounts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) (dubbed “forever chemicals”) have been dumped into the environment, causing heavy contamination of soil, surface water, and groundwater sources. humans, animals, and the environment are frequently exposed to pfas through food, water, consumer products, as well as waste streams from pfas-manufacturing industries. pfas are a large group of synthetic organic fluorinated compounds with widely diverse chemical structures that are extremely resistant to microbial degradation. their persistence, toxicity to life on earth, bioaccumulation tendencies, and adverse health and ecological effects have earned them a “top priority pollutant” designation by regulatory bodies. despite that a number of physicochemical methods exist for pfas treatment, they suffer from major drawbacks regarding high costs, use of high energy and incomplete mineralization (destruction of the c[sbnd]f bond). consequently, microbial degradation and enzymatic treatment of pfas are highly sought after as they offer a complete, cheaper, sustainable, and environmentally friendly alternative. in this critical review, we provide an overview of the classification, properties, and interaction of pfas within the environment relevant to microbial degradation. we discuss latest developments in the biodegradation of pfas by microbes, transformation routes, transformation products and degradative enzymes. finally, we highlight the existing challenges, limitations, and prospects of bioremediation approaches in treating pfas and proffer possible solutions and future research directions. © 2022 elsevier b.v."

new emission inventory reveals termination of global dioxin declining trend,"accurate estimates of spatiotemporally resolved polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (pcdd/fs, or dioxins) emissions are critical for understanding their environmental fate and associated health risks. in this study, by utilizing an empirical regression model for pcdd/fs emissions, we developed a global emission inventory for 17 toxic pcdd/fs congeners from 8 source sectors with a spatial resolution of 1° × 1° from 2002 to 2018. the results show that pcdd/fs emissions decreased by 25.7 % (12.5 kg teq) between 2002 and 2018, mostly occurring in upper- and lower-middle income countries. globally, open-burning processes, waste incineration, ferrous and nonferrous metal production sectors and heat and power generation were the major source sectors of pcdd/fs. spatially, high pcdd/fs emissions were mainly identified in east and south asia, southeast asia, and part of sub-saharan africa. we find that the declining trend of dioxin emissions over the past decades terminated from the early 2010s due to increasing significance of wildfire induced emissions in the total emission. the pcdd/fs emission inventory developed in the present study was verified by inputting the inventory as initial conditions into an atmospheric transport model, the canadian model for environmental transport of organochlorine pesticides (canmetop), to simulate pcdd/fs concentrations in air and soil. the predicted concentrations were compared to field sampling data. the good agreement between the modeled and measured concentrations demonstrates the reliability of the inventory. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",soil,0,"new emission inventory reveals termination of global dioxin declining trend accurate estimates of spatiotemporally resolved polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (pcdd/fs, or dioxins) emissions are critical for understanding their environmental fate and associated health risks. in this study, by utilizing an empirical regression model for pcdd/fs emissions, we developed a global emission inventory for 17 toxic pcdd/fs congeners from 8 source sectors with a spatial resolution of 1° × 1° from 2002 to 2018. the results show that pcdd/fs emissions decreased by 25.7 % (12.5 kg teq) between 2002 and 2018, mostly occurring in upper- and lower-middle income countries. globally, open-burning processes, waste incineration, ferrous and nonferrous metal production sectors and heat and power generation were the major source sectors of pcdd/fs. spatially, high pcdd/fs emissions were mainly identified in east and south asia, southeast asia, and part of sub-saharan africa. we find that the declining trend of dioxin emissions over the past decades terminated from the early 2010s due to increasing significance of wildfire induced emissions in the total emission. the pcdd/fs emission inventory developed in the present study was verified by inputting the inventory as initial conditions into an atmospheric transport model, the canadian model for environmental transport of organochlorine pesticides (canmetop), to simulate pcdd/fs concentrations in air and soil. the predicted concentrations were compared to field sampling data. the good agreement between the modeled and measured concentrations demonstrates the reliability of the inventory. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
"iron-modified phosphorus- and silicon-based biochars exhibited various influences on arsenic, cadmium, and lead accumulation in rice and enzyme activities in a paddy soil","contamination of paddy soils with potentially toxic elements (ptes) has become a severe environmental issue. application of functionalized biochar for rice cultivation has been proposed as an effective means to reduce environmental risks of these ptes in paddy soils. this work was undertaken to seek the positive effects of a rice husk-derived silicon (si)-rich biochar (si-bc) and a pig carcass-derived phosphorus (p)-rich biochar (p-bc), as well as their fe-modified biochars (fe-si-bc and fe-p-bc) on the enzyme activity and pte availability in an as-cd-pb-contaminated soil. a rice cultivation pot trial was conducted using these functionalized biochars as soil amendments for the alleviation of pte accumulation in rice plants. results showed that si-bc decreased the concentrations of as in rice grain and straw by 59.4 % and 61.4 %, respectively, while fe-si-bc significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced plant growth, increasing grain yield (by 38.6 %). fe-si-bc significantly (p < 0.05) elevated cd and pb accumulation in rice plants. p-bc enhanced the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase, and urease, and reduced grain-pb and straw-pb by 49.3 % and 43.2 %, respectively. however, fe-p-bc reduced plant-as in rice grain and straw by 12.2 % and 51.2 %, respectively, but increased plant-cd and plant-pb. thus, fe-modified si- and p-rich biochars could remediate paddy soils contaminated with as, and enhance the yield and quality of rice. application of pristine p-rich biochar could also be a promising strategy to remediate the pb-contaminated paddy soils and limit pb accumulation in rice. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",soil,0,"iron-modified phosphorus- and silicon-based biochars exhibited various influences on arsenic, cadmium, and lead accumulation in rice and enzyme activities in a paddy soil contamination of paddy soils with potentially toxic elements (ptes) has become a severe environmental issue. application of functionalized biochar for rice cultivation has been proposed as an effective means to reduce environmental risks of these ptes in paddy soils. this work was undertaken to seek the positive effects of a rice husk-derived silicon (si)-rich biochar (si-bc) and a pig carcass-derived phosphorus (p)-rich biochar (p-bc), as well as their fe-modified biochars (fe-si-bc and fe-p-bc) on the enzyme activity and pte availability in an as-cd-pb-contaminated soil. a rice cultivation pot trial was conducted using these functionalized biochars as soil amendments for the alleviation of pte accumulation in rice plants. results showed that si-bc decreased the concentrations of as in rice grain and straw by 59.4 % and 61.4 %, respectively, while fe-si-bc significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced plant growth, increasing grain yield (by 38.6 %). fe-si-bc significantly (p < 0.05) elevated cd and pb accumulation in rice plants. p-bc enhanced the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase, and urease, and reduced grain-pb and straw-pb by 49.3 % and 43.2 %, respectively. however, fe-p-bc reduced plant-as in rice grain and straw by 12.2 % and 51.2 %, respectively, but increased plant-cd and plant-pb. thus, fe-modified si- and p-rich biochars could remediate paddy soils contaminated with as, and enhance the yield and quality of rice. application of pristine p-rich biochar could also be a promising strategy to remediate the pb-contaminated paddy soils and limit pb accumulation in rice. © 2022 elsevier b.v."

soil reinforcement by waste tire textile fibers: small-scale experimental tests,"due to the fast-growing number of cars, the amount of scrap tires is quickly increasing across the world. because buried tires need a long period of time to dissolve, the accumulation of scrap tires in different countries has caused several social, economic, and environmental issues worldwide. many researchers in geotechnical engineering have utilized scrap tires in various forms for soil reinforcement in recent years. a by-product of waste tire processing is waste tire textile fiber (wttf). these wttfs are classified as special wastes, and they are frequently buried or burned in violation of international law. this study experimentally shows that these materials could be recycled and mixed with soil to improve the mixture mechanical properties. a complete series of small-scale laboratory tests, including direct shear test, brazilian tensile test, permeability test, and swelling test, was conducted to examine the possibility of reusing wttfs as soil-reinforcing agents. five different fiber percentages (fps), i.e., 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4%, of soil dry weight were mixed with the soil and the mechanical behavior of the mixture was investigated. the test results suggest that adding fiber to the soil improves both its shear and tensile strengths. the material ductility increases by adding the fiber to the soil as well. further, the soil mixed with the fiber has a greater permeability coefficient and has less swelling potential. the mixture with these improved mechanical properties can cause less lateral pressure in case of being used as a backfill material. as a result, rather than being buried or burned, these wastes could be utilized to enhance the mechanical properties of various types of soils in geotechnical applications. the testing procedures and results are reported, discussed, and compared with those from the literature. © 2022 american society of civil engineers.",soil,0,"soil reinforcement by waste tire textile fibers: small-scale experimental tests due to the fast-growing number of cars, the amount of scrap tires is quickly increasing across the world. because buried tires need a long period of time to dissolve, the accumulation of scrap tires in different countries has caused several social, economic, and environmental issues worldwide. many researchers in geotechnical engineering have utilized scrap tires in various forms for soil reinforcement in recent years. a by-product of waste tire processing is waste tire textile fiber (wttf). these wttfs are classified as special wastes, and they are frequently buried or burned in violation of international law. this study experimentally shows that these materials could be recycled and mixed with soil to improve the mixture mechanical properties. a complete series of small-scale laboratory tests, including direct shear test, brazilian tensile test, permeability test, and swelling test, was conducted to examine the possibility of reusing wttfs as soil-reinforcing agents. five different fiber percentages (fps), i.e., 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4%, of soil dry weight were mixed with the soil and the mechanical behavior of the mixture was investigated. the test results suggest that adding fiber to the soil improves both its shear and tensile strengths. the material ductility increases by adding the fiber to the soil as well. further, the soil mixed with the fiber has a greater permeability coefficient and has less swelling potential. the mixture with these improved mechanical properties can cause less lateral pressure in case of being used as a backfill material. as a result, rather than being buried or burned, these wastes could be utilized to enhance the mechanical properties of various types of soils in geotechnical applications. the testing procedures and results are reported, discussed, and compared with those from the literature. © 2022 american society of civil engineers."

responses of bacterial communities to microplastics: more sensitive in less fertile soils,"recently, the potential impact of microplastics (mps) on bacterial communities has risen enormously attention due to the increasing amount of plastic waste generated nowadays. however, there is a lack of clarity due to limited studies on the responses of bacterial communities to mps exposures in various soil ecosystems. here, we conducted a soil microcosm experiment to analyze the potential impact of mps on bacterial communities in farmland soil, forest soil, and sandy soil. the changes in alpha/beta diversity and co-occurrence network of bacterial communities were more significant in farmland soil amended with ps mps (5 g kg−1), forest soil amended with pp mps (5 g kg−1), and sandy soil amended with pp mps (1 g kg−1). particularly, the bacterial communities in sandy soil with the least soil organic carbon content were disturbed most significantly compared to other treatments. lefse analysis revealed that specific bacterial taxa such as phylum proteobacteria, actinobacteria, firmicutes, and genus sphingomonas, candidatus udaeobacter, gemmatimonas, were sensitive to mps exposures. functional annotation showed that perturbation of bacterial communities was related to organic carbon decomposition, nitrogen fixation, nitrate reduction/respiration, etc. in sum, mps may potentially affect bacterial community structure and functions relevant to carbon/nitrogen cycles at long-term realistic field exposure. © 2022",soil,0,"responses of bacterial communities to microplastics: more sensitive in less fertile soils recently, the potential impact of microplastics (mps) on bacterial communities has risen enormously attention due to the increasing amount of plastic waste generated nowadays. however, there is a lack of clarity due to limited studies on the responses of bacterial communities to mps exposures in various soil ecosystems. here, we conducted a soil microcosm experiment to analyze the potential impact of mps on bacterial communities in farmland soil, forest soil, and sandy soil. the changes in alpha/beta diversity and co-occurrence network of bacterial communities were more significant in farmland soil amended with ps mps (5 g kg−1), forest soil amended with pp mps (5 g kg−1), and sandy soil amended with pp mps (1 g kg−1). particularly, the bacterial communities in sandy soil with the least soil organic carbon content were disturbed most significantly compared to other treatments. lefse analysis revealed that specific bacterial taxa such as phylum proteobacteria, actinobacteria, firmicutes, and genus sphingomonas, candidatus udaeobacter, gemmatimonas, were sensitive to mps exposures. functional annotation showed that perturbation of bacterial communities was related to organic carbon decomposition, nitrogen fixation, nitrate reduction/respiration, etc. in sum, mps may potentially affect bacterial community structure and functions relevant to carbon/nitrogen cycles at long-term realistic field exposure. © 2022"

impact of different organic matters on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in activated sludge,"the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (args) in various environments has drawn worldwide attention due to their potential risks. previous studies have reported that a variety of substances can enhance the occurrence and dissemination of args. however, few studies have compared the response of args under the stress of different organic matters in biological wastewater treatment systems. in this study, seven organic pollutants were added into wastewater treatment bioreactors to investigate their impacts on the arg occurrence in activated sludge. based on high-throughput sequencing, it was found that the microbial communities and arg patterns were significantly changed in the activated sludge exposed to these organic pollutants. compared with the non-antibiotic refractory organic matters, antibiotics not only increased the abundance of args but also significantly changed the arg compositions. the increase of gram-negative bacteria (e.g., archangium, prosthecobacter and dokdonella) carrying args could be the main cause of arg proliferation. in addition, significant co-occurrence relationships between args and mobile genetic elements were also observed in the sludge samples, which may also affect the arg diversity and abundance during the organic matter treatment in the bioreactors. overall, these findings provide new information for better understanding the arg occurrence and dissemination caused by organic pollutants in wastewater treatment systems. © 2022",water,1,"impact of different organic matters on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in activated sludge the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (args) in various environments has drawn worldwide attention due to their potential risks. previous studies have reported that a variety of substances can enhance the occurrence and dissemination of args. however, few studies have compared the response of args under the stress of different organic matters in biological wastewater treatment systems. in this study, seven organic pollutants were added into wastewater treatment bioreactors to investigate their impacts on the arg occurrence in activated sludge. based on high-throughput sequencing, it was found that the microbial communities and arg patterns were significantly changed in the activated sludge exposed to these organic pollutants. compared with the non-antibiotic refractory organic matters, antibiotics not only increased the abundance of args but also significantly changed the arg compositions. the increase of gram-negative bacteria (e.g., archangium, prosthecobacter and dokdonella) carrying args could be the main cause of arg proliferation. in addition, significant co-occurrence relationships between args and mobile genetic elements were also observed in the sludge samples, which may also affect the arg diversity and abundance during the organic matter treatment in the bioreactors. overall, these findings provide new information for better understanding the arg occurrence and dissemination caused by organic pollutants in wastewater treatment systems. © 2022"

catalytic oxidation mechanism of ash3 over cuo@sio2 core-shell catalysts via experimental and theoretical studies,"in this study, cuo@sio2 core-shell catalysts were successfully synthesized and applied to efficiently remove hazardous gaseous pollutant arsine (ash3) by catalytic oxidation under low-temperature and low-oxygen conditions for the first time. in typical experiments, the cuo@sio2 catalysts showed excellent ash3 removal activity and stability under low-temperature and low-oxygen conditions. the duration of the ash3 conversion rate above 90 % for the cuo@sio2 catalysts was 39 h, which was markedly higher than that of other catalysts previously reported in the literature. the considerable catalytic activity and stability were attributed to the protection and confinement effects of the sio2 shell, which resulted in highly dispersed cuo nanoparticles. meanwhile, the strong interaction between the cuo core and sio2 shell further facilitated the formation of active species such as coordinatively unsaturated cu2+ and chemisorbed oxygen. the accumulation of oxidation products (as2o3 and as2o5) on the interface between the cuo core and sio2 shell and the pore channels of the sio2 shell is the main cause of catalysts deactivation. furthermore, through combined density functional theory (dft) calculations and characterization methods, a reaction pathway including gradual dehydrogenation (ash3*→ash2*→ash*→as*) and gradual oxidation (2as*→as*+aso*→2aso*→as2o3) for the catalytic oxidation of ash3 on cuo (111) surface was constructed to clarify the detailed reaction mechanism. the cuo@sio2 core-shell catalysts applied in this study could provide a powerful method for developing ash3 catalysts from multiple know ash3 removal systems. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",air,2,"catalytic oxidation mechanism of ash3 over cuo@sio2 core-shell catalysts via experimental and theoretical studies in this study, cuo@sio2 core-shell catalysts were successfully synthesized and applied to efficiently remove hazardous gaseous pollutant arsine (ash3) by catalytic oxidation under low-temperature and low-oxygen conditions for the first time. in typical experiments, the cuo@sio2 catalysts showed excellent ash3 removal activity and stability under low-temperature and low-oxygen conditions. the duration of the ash3 conversion rate above 90 % for the cuo@sio2 catalysts was 39 h, which was markedly higher than that of other catalysts previously reported in the literature. the considerable catalytic activity and stability were attributed to the protection and confinement effects of the sio2 shell, which resulted in highly dispersed cuo nanoparticles. meanwhile, the strong interaction between the cuo core and sio2 shell further facilitated the formation of active species such as coordinatively unsaturated cu2+ and chemisorbed oxygen. the accumulation of oxidation products (as2o3 and as2o5) on the interface between the cuo core and sio2 shell and the pore channels of the sio2 shell is the main cause of catalysts deactivation. furthermore, through combined density functional theory (dft) calculations and characterization methods, a reaction pathway including gradual dehydrogenation (ash3*→ash2*→ash*→as*) and gradual oxidation (2as*→as*+aso*→2aso*→as2o3) for the catalytic oxidation of ash3 on cuo (111) surface was constructed to clarify the detailed reaction mechanism. the cuo@sio2 core-shell catalysts applied in this study could provide a powerful method for developing ash3 catalysts from multiple know ash3 removal systems. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
"a review on migration and transformation of nitrogen during sewage sludge thermochemical treatment: focusing on pyrolysis, gasification and combustion","sewage sludge, a typical municipal solid waste, contains a large number of combustible components such as c and h, and has a high value of energy development and utilization. thermochemical treatment is one of the advanced directions and developing trends in solid waste treatment. due to the high content of nitrogen in sewage sludge, the influence of nitrogen behavior and environmental effect (especially the release of nox precursors) on air pollution, ozone layer destruction and acid rain in the process of thermochemical treatment cannot be ignored. this paper reviewed the distribution, migration and transformation mechanism of nitrogen in sewage sludge during pyrolysis, gasification and combustion. nitrogen is involved in the formation of char, tar, and gas in the three-phase products during sewage sludge pyrolysis, while nitrogen oxide precursors (nh3 and hcn) in the gas phase are mainly concerned in gasification, while nox release in the gas phase is mainly concerned in combustion. meanwhile, the factors (including temperature, reaction atmosphere, pretreatment, etc.) affecting nitrogen migration and transformation in sewage sludge during thermochemical transformation were summarized. the current control methods to reduce nox and nox precursors generation were also summarized. finally, the challenges of further prevention of nox production and the exploration of new methods for sewage sludge reclamation are presented. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",air,2,"a review on migration and transformation of nitrogen during sewage sludge thermochemical treatment: focusing on pyrolysis, gasification and combustion sewage sludge, a typical municipal solid waste, contains a large number of combustible components such as c and h, and has a high value of energy development and utilization. thermochemical treatment is one of the advanced directions and developing trends in solid waste treatment. due to the high content of nitrogen in sewage sludge, the influence of nitrogen behavior and environmental effect (especially the release of nox precursors) on air pollution, ozone layer destruction and acid rain in the process of thermochemical treatment cannot be ignored. this paper reviewed the distribution, migration and transformation mechanism of nitrogen in sewage sludge during pyrolysis, gasification and combustion. nitrogen is involved in the formation of char, tar, and gas in the three-phase products during sewage sludge pyrolysis, while nitrogen oxide precursors (nh3 and hcn) in the gas phase are mainly concerned in gasification, while nox release in the gas phase is mainly concerned in combustion. meanwhile, the factors (including temperature, reaction atmosphere, pretreatment, etc.) affecting nitrogen migration and transformation in sewage sludge during thermochemical transformation were summarized. the current control methods to reduce nox and nox precursors generation were also summarized. finally, the challenges of further prevention of nox production and the exploration of new methods for sewage sludge reclamation are presented. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
"airborne microplastics: occurrence, sources, fate, risks and mitigation","this paper serves to enhance the current knowledge base of airborne microplastics which is significantly smaller than that of microplastics in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. it systematically presents the prevalence, sources, fate, risks and mitigations of airborne microplastics through the review of &gt;140 scientific papers published mainly in the last 10 years. unlike the extant review, it places an emphasis on the indoor microplastics, the risks of airborne microplastics on animals and plants and their mitigations. the outdoor microplastics are mostly generated by the wear and tear of tires, brake pads, waste incineration and industrial activities. they have been detected in many regions worldwide at concentrations ranging from 0.3 particles/m3 to 154,000 particles/l of air even in the pyrenees mountains and the arctic. as for indoor microplastics, the reported concentrations range from 1 piece/m3 to 9900 pieces/m2/day, and are frequently higher than those of the outdoor microplastics. they come from the wear and tear of walls and ceilings, synthetic textiles and furniture finishings. airborne microplastics could be suspended and resuspended, entrapped, settle under gravity as well as interact with chemicals, microorganisms and other microplastic particles. in the outdoors, they could also interact with sunlight and be carried by the wind over long distance. airborne microplastics could adversely affect plants, animals and humans, leading to reduced photosynthetic rate, retarded growth, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and increased cancer risks in humans. they could be mitigated indirectly through filters attached to air-conditioning system and directly through source reduction, regulation and biodegradable substitutes. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",air,2,"airborne microplastics: occurrence, sources, fate, risks and mitigation this paper serves to enhance the current knowledge base of airborne microplastics which is significantly smaller than that of microplastics in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. it systematically presents the prevalence, sources, fate, risks and mitigations of airborne microplastics through the review of &gt;140 scientific papers published mainly in the last 10 years. unlike the extant review, it places an emphasis on the indoor microplastics, the risks of airborne microplastics on animals and plants and their mitigations. the outdoor microplastics are mostly generated by the wear and tear of tires, brake pads, waste incineration and industrial activities. they have been detected in many regions worldwide at concentrations ranging from 0.3 particles/m3 to 154,000 particles/l of air even in the pyrenees mountains and the arctic. as for indoor microplastics, the reported concentrations range from 1 piece/m3 to 9900 pieces/m2/day, and are frequently higher than those of the outdoor microplastics. they come from the wear and tear of walls and ceilings, synthetic textiles and furniture finishings. airborne microplastics could be suspended and resuspended, entrapped, settle under gravity as well as interact with chemicals, microorganisms and other microplastic particles. in the outdoors, they could also interact with sunlight and be carried by the wind over long distance. airborne microplastics could adversely affect plants, animals and humans, leading to reduced photosynthetic rate, retarded growth, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and increased cancer risks in humans. they could be mitigated indirectly through filters attached to air-conditioning system and directly through source reduction, regulation and biodegradable substitutes. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
overview of temporary radioxenon background measurement campaigns conducted for the ctbto between 2008 and 2018,"the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty (ctbt) specifies that an overall network of at least 40 international monitoring system (ims) stations should monitor the presence of radioxenon in the atmosphere upon its entry into force. the measurement of radioxenon concentrations in the air is one of the major techniques to detect underground nuclear explosions. it is, together with radionuclide particulate monitoring, the only component of the network able to confirm whether an event originates from a nuclear test, leaving the final proof to on-site inspection. correct and accurate interpretation of radioxenon detections by state signatories is a key parameter of the verification regime of the preparatory commission for the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organization (ctbto). in this context, the discrimination between the highly variable radioxenon background generated by normal operations of nuclear facilities and ctbt-relevant events is a challenging, but critical, task. to this end, the radioxenon background that can be expected at ims noble gas systems must be sufficiently characterized and understood. all activities conducted to study the global radioxenon background are focused on the calibration and performance of the verification system as described in the treaty. the unique ctbto noble gas system network is designed to optimally covering the globe. by the end of 2019, 31 systems were put in operation, 25 of which being already certified. it took two decades from the first experimental setup of noble gas system in the field to reach this stage of maturity. in the meantime, it was an urgent need to gain empirical evidence of atmospheric radioxenon concentrations with the full spectrum of characteristics that ims noble gas systems may be observing. this experience was significantly advanced through temporary measurement campaigns. their objective was to gain the additional necessary knowledge for a correct understanding and categorization of radioxenon detections. the site selection for these campaigns put emphasis on regions with low coverage by the initially few experimental noble gas systems at ims locations or where potential interferences with normal background might be observed. short-term measurements were first initiated in 2008. sites of potential interest were identified, and campaigns up to few weeks were performed. based on the findings of these short campaigns, transportable systems were procured by the ctbto. longer temporary measurement campaigns were started afterwards and operated by local hosts in different regions of the globe. site selections were based on purely scientific criteria. objectives of the measurement campaigns were continually reassessed, and projects were designed to meet the scientific needs for radioxenon background understanding as required for nuclear explosion monitoring. as of today, several thousands of samples have been collected and measured. spectra of temporary measurement campaigns were (and are still) analysed in the international data centre (idc). as they are not part of the ctbt monitoring system, no idc product is generated. analysis results are stored in a non-operational database of the ctbto and made

air quality assessment in biosphere reserves close to emission sources. the case of the spanish “tablas de daimiel” national park,"this work shows that biosphere reserves, national parks and other protected natural areas require in situ tools to monitor and detect local and remote air pollution sources which are a threat to flora, fauna water and soil. industries in surrounding areas, traffic and long-range transport of air pollution, can change with time and meteorology and so each national park should also have a historical database of the air quality in the site. this study reports surface measurements of ozone, no, no2, co, so2 and pm2.5 acquired from march 2020 to july 2021 in “las tablas de daimiel”, a wetland mediterranean national park bordered by different cities and new industries in the field of the revalorization of agricultural wastes. simultaneous data from a background station in a rural area isolated from air pollution are considered as reference. twelve campaigns of one week duration were also performed to sample air in sorbent tubes to analyse volatile organic compounds from anthropogenic sources. data are discussed considering meteorology, especially wind speed and direction together with the assessment of back-trajectories of air masses from distant sources. the results show that the effects of pollution from local and faraway sources on air quality in the park were weak. thus, except for the high levels of ozone, with a mean value of 71 μg.m−3, measured mass loadings for pollutants were low and not in exceedance of the air quality standards. saharan dust events were frequent and contributed to pm2.5 levels in the site. nox and so2 average concentrations (3.2 and 0.4 μg.m−3, respectively) were below the recommended critical levels for vegetation and all the quantified vocs were found in average concentration levels below 0.5 μg.m−3. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",air,2,"air quality assessment in biosphere reserves close to emission sources. the case of the spanish “tablas de daimiel” national park this work shows that biosphere reserves, national parks and other protected natural areas require in situ tools to monitor and detect local and remote air pollution sources which are a threat to flora, fauna water and soil. industries in surrounding areas, traffic and long-range transport of air pollution, can change with time and meteorology and so each national park should also have a historical database of the air quality in the site. this study reports surface measurements of ozone, no, no2, co, so2 and pm2.5 acquired from march 2020 to july 2021 in “las tablas de daimiel”, a wetland mediterranean national park bordered by different cities and new industries in the field of the revalorization of agricultural wastes. simultaneous data from a background station in a rural area isolated from air pollution are considered as reference. twelve campaigns of one week duration were also performed to sample air in sorbent tubes to analyse volatile organic compounds from anthropogenic sources. data are discussed considering meteorology, especially wind speed and direction together with the assessment of back-trajectories of air masses from distant sources. the results show that the effects of pollution from local and faraway sources on air quality in the park were weak. thus, except for the high levels of ozone, with a mean value of 71 μg.m−3, measured mass loadings for pollutants were low and not in exceedance of the air quality standards. saharan dust events were frequent and contributed to pm2.5 levels in the site. nox and so2 average concentrations (3.2 and 0.4 μg.m−3, respectively) were below the recommended critical levels for vegetation and all the quantified vocs were found in average concentration levels below 0.5 μg.m−3. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
the simultaneous removal of nox and so2 from flue gas by direct injection of sorbents in furnace of waste incinerator,"a effective pollution source control technology (called sdns) has been developed to simultaneously remove nox and so2 from flue gas by direct injection of fine denitration (denox) and desulfuration (desox) agents (named dns and dss, respectively) into the furnace of 300 t·d-1 waste incinerator. 75 % denox efficiency and 95 % desox efficiency could be acquired by simultaneous injection of 0.4 g·m−3 dns and 0.6 g·m−3 dss, and the sdns system can run steadily with less than 80 mg·m−3 nox and 10 mg·m−3 so2 left in flue gas, which can be comparable with the complex and expensive tail-end purification processes of flue gas. the interaction and interspersion between the active components and the polymer in dns and dss facilitate their high reactivity with nox and so2 at high temperatures, and the synergistic effect between dns and dss in furnace further decreases their consumption. the composition analysis of ash demonstrates that the majority of injected fine dns and dss particles flowed out with the flue gas, and only a fraction of them was left in furnace. in addition, the simple sdns process can not only lower the sorbent consumption but also cut down two-thirds of the investment and operating costs compared with the traditional denox and desox process. the demonstrated technological and economic advantages of the sdns process signify its promising application prospect for the source control of nox and so2 emissions from small and medium-sized waste incineration projects. © 2022 elsevier ltd",air,2,"the simultaneous removal of nox and so2 from flue gas by direct injection of sorbents in furnace of waste incinerator a effective pollution source control technology (called sdns) has been developed to simultaneously remove nox and so2 from flue gas by direct injection of fine denitration (denox) and desulfuration (desox) agents (named dns and dss, respectively) into the furnace of 300 t·d-1 waste incinerator. 75 % denox efficiency and 95 % desox efficiency could be acquired by simultaneous injection of 0.4 g·m−3 dns and 0.6 g·m−3 dss, and the sdns system can run steadily with less than 80 mg·m−3 nox and 10 mg·m−3 so2 left in flue gas, which can be comparable with the complex and expensive tail-end purification processes of flue gas. the interaction and interspersion between the active components and the polymer in dns and dss facilitate their high reactivity with nox and so2 at high temperatures, and the synergistic effect between dns and dss in furnace further decreases their consumption. the composition analysis of ash demonstrates that the majority of injected fine dns and dss particles flowed out with the flue gas, and only a fraction of them was left in furnace. in addition, the simple sdns process can not only lower the sorbent consumption but also cut down two-thirds of the investment and operating costs compared with the traditional denox and desox process. the demonstrated technological and economic advantages of the sdns process signify its promising application prospect for the source control of nox and so2 emissions from small and medium-sized waste incineration projects. © 2022 elsevier ltd"

study on the feasibility of converting the recovered volatile organic compounds to syngas via catalytic steam reforming for gas-fueled power generation,"volatile organic compounds (vocs) are major air pollutants. the most common approach for removing vocs is by exhaust gas recovery. however, due to the complexity and high cost of purification, recovered vocs are frequently burned as waste rather than repurposed as raw materials, limiting their utilization efficiency. this study proposes a novel strategy for improving the utilization efficiency of recovered vocs that comprises converting recovered vocs into syngas via catalytic steam reforming and employing the produced syngas as fuel for internal combustion engines (ices) to generate power. to investigate the feasibility of this technique, thermodynamic simulations and steam reforming experiments were performed on typical vocs such as toluene, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, and a mixture of these. based on the thermodynamic simulation findings, different vocs were converted to syngas with lower heating values (lhvs) ranging from 4.72 to 6.86 mj/kg, which could be directly used in ices for power generation. the total power output was 2.49–3.73 kwh per kg of voc. after deducting the in-house operation consumption, the net-out power output was approximately 0.82–1.89 kwh. the experimental results were in good agreement with the simulation data. therefore, the proposed strategy has a great application potential. © 2022 elsevier ltd",air,2,"study on the feasibility of converting the recovered volatile organic compounds to syngas via catalytic steam reforming for gas-fueled power generation volatile organic compounds (vocs) are major air pollutants. the most common approach for removing vocs is by exhaust gas recovery. however, due to the complexity and high cost of purification, recovered vocs are frequently burned as waste rather than repurposed as raw materials, limiting their utilization efficiency. this study proposes a novel strategy for improving the utilization efficiency of recovered vocs that comprises converting recovered vocs into syngas via catalytic steam reforming and employing the produced syngas as fuel for internal combustion engines (ices) to generate power. to investigate the feasibility of this technique, thermodynamic simulations and steam reforming experiments were performed on typical vocs such as toluene, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, and a mixture of these. based on the thermodynamic simulation findings, different vocs were converted to syngas with lower heating values (lhvs) ranging from 4.72 to 6.86 mj/kg, which could be directly used in ices for power generation. the total power output was 2.49–3.73 kwh per kg of voc. after deducting the in-house operation consumption, the net-out power output was approximately 0.82–1.89 kwh. the experimental results were in good agreement with the simulation data. therefore, the proposed strategy has a great application potential. © 2022 elsevier ltd"

thallium separation from wastewater using α-feooh@biochar: efficacy and mechanism,"thallium (tl) is an untraditional toxic metal. emerging tl pollution has received increasing concerns. despite its extreme biotoxicity, tl is an irreplaceable element for specific high-tech fields (e.g., superconductors, semiconductors, and optical fibers) due to its peculiar physio-chemical properties. besides, tl has been also regarded as critical strategic metal owing to its low abundance and scarcity in the earth's crust. herein, a novel composite of α-feooh@bc was facilely synthesized via biochar modification with environmentally abundant iron oxides (α-feooh) to separate tl(i) from wastewater. the results showed that overall large distribution coefficient values (kd &gt; 5000 ml/g) of tl separation by α-feooh@bc in a wide ph range (5.0–11.0) were achieved, suggesting a generally promising tl separation capacity. multiple characterizations with scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (sem-eds), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), x-ray diffraction (xrd) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) indicate that the dominant tl separation mechanisms included electrostatic attraction, ion exchange and complexation. these findings indicate that the α-feooh@bc material may have important application in tl separation from industrial wastewaters, which are usually moderately acidic with ph values ranging from 5.0 to 7.0. this study offers novel perspectives on using environmental abundant iron oxides modified biochar for easy and fast separation of tl from industrial wastewater. all these findings can facilitate to develop waste-to-resources strategy for recycling tl in the loop of circular economy and industrial symbiosis. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",metal,3,"thallium separation from wastewater using α-feooh@biochar: efficacy and mechanism thallium (tl) is an untraditional toxic metal. emerging tl pollution has received increasing concerns. despite its extreme biotoxicity, tl is an irreplaceable element for specific high-tech fields (e.g., superconductors, semiconductors, and optical fibers) due to its peculiar physio-chemical properties. besides, tl has been also regarded as critical strategic metal owing to its low abundance and scarcity in the earth's crust. herein, a novel composite of α-feooh@bc was facilely synthesized via biochar modification with environmentally abundant iron oxides (α-feooh) to separate tl(i) from wastewater. the results showed that overall large distribution coefficient values (kd &gt; 5000 ml/g) of tl separation by α-feooh@bc in a wide ph range (5.0–11.0) were achieved, suggesting a generally promising tl separation capacity. multiple characterizations with scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (sem-eds), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), x-ray diffraction (xrd) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) indicate that the dominant tl separation mechanisms included electrostatic attraction, ion exchange and complexation. these findings indicate that the α-feooh@bc material may have important application in tl separation from industrial wastewaters, which are usually moderately acidic with ph values ranging from 5.0 to 7.0. this study offers novel perspectives on using environmental abundant iron oxides modified biochar for easy and fast separation of tl from industrial wastewater. all these findings can facilitate to develop waste-to-resources strategy for recycling tl in the loop of circular economy and industrial symbiosis. © 2022 elsevier b.v."

cu extraction from waste copper clad laminate sorting residue in a two-stage bioleaching process: process optimization and mechanism [废覆铜板分选残渣生物脱毒工艺优化及机理],"much waste copper clad laminate sorting residue is generated from the flotation process of recovering copper resources from waste printed circuit boards. the improper treatment and disposal of waste copper clad laminate sorting residue harms the environment and human health. according to the national hazardous waste list (2021 edition) of china, this waste belongs to hw13 (900-451-13) hazardous waste. the sorting residue contains approximately 1% copper, which is similar to the average copper grade of 0.8% in china. therefore, this residue is an important copper renewable resource and has a high potential for copper recycling. to optimize the effective factors, including the fe2+ concentration, initial solution ph value, and pulp density, and clarify the mechanism during the bioleaching process of waste copper clad laminate sorting residue, a box–behnken design of response surface methodology was first used, and a scheme consisting of 17 experiments was designed in the present study. through the multiple regression fitting analysis of experimental results, a quadratic polynomial regression model was established. the regression model showed high reliability and simulation accuracy and was then used to optimize the bioleaching process. under the optimal conditions (6.13 g·l−1 fe2+, initial leaching solution ph value of 1.65, and pulp density of 30%), 92.2% maximum cu extraction was obtained. then, a modified scale-up bioleaching experiment in a 100-l stirred tank was performed. the results indicated that the maximum copper recovery reached 98%, and less than 0.02% of copper was detected in the bioleaching residue after 6 h of bioleaching because of the improved bioleaching operating conditions in the 100-l stirred tank, including slowly adding the sorting residue, additional stirring (200 r·min−1), aerating (20 l·h−1), and controlling the bulk ph value (solution ph value &lt;2.5 adjusted with 50% (v/v) h2so4). leaching kinetic data described by a modified shrinking core model indicated that interfacial transfer and diffusion across the solid film layer controlled the copper dissolution kinetics. in conclusion, copper in the sorting residue was dissolved primarily by fe3+ oxidation and secondarily by h+ attack throughout the bioleaching process. notably, the continuous regeneration of fe3+ by an iron-oxidation microbial consortium led to more fe3+ distributed across the solid film layer of residual iron/calcium compounds and accumulated on the reacted core, which not only reduced total iron consumption (particularly fe3+) but also substantially improved copper extraction from

petroleum refinery effluent contribution to chemical mixture toxic pressure in the environment,"petroleum refinery effluents (pre) are wastewaters from industries associated with oil refining. within europe, pres are regulated through local discharge permits and receive substantial treatment before emission. after treatment, pres can still contain low levels of various pollutants potentially toxic to organisms. earlier work, including whole-effluent toxicity assessments, has shown that the toxicity of permitted pres is often limited. however, the extent to which pres contribute to chemical pollution already present in the receiving environment is unknown. therefore, our study aimed to assess the contribution of pres to mixture toxic pressure in the environment, using the multi-substance potentially affected fraction of species (mspaf) as an indicator. based on measured chemical concentrations, compiled species sensitivity distributions (ssd) and a mechanistic solubility model, mspaf levels were estimated for undiluted effluents at discharge points and diluted effluents downstream in receiving waters. median mspaf-chronic and mspaf-acute levels of pres at discharge points were 74% (p50) and 40% (p95), respectively. the calculated mspaf levels were reduced substantially to <5% downstream for most effluents (82%), indicating low to negligible toxicity of pres in receiving environments beyond the initial mixing zone. regardless of differences in endpoints and locations, hydrocarbons (mainly total petroleum hydrocarbons) and inorganics (mainly ammonia) explained at least 85% of the mixture toxic pressure. the mspaf levels of pres were on average 2.5–4.5 orders of magnitude lower than mspaf levels derived from background pollution levels, suggesting that pres were minor contributors to the toxic pressure in the environment. this study presents a generic methodology for quantifying the potential toxic pressure of pres in the environment, identifying hotspots where more effective wastewater treatment could be needed. we explicitly discuss the uncertainties for further refinement and development of the method. © 2022 the authors",chemical,4,"petroleum refinery effluent contribution to chemical mixture toxic pressure in the environment petroleum refinery effluents (pre) are wastewaters from industries associated with oil refining. within europe, pres are regulated through local discharge permits and receive substantial treatment before emission. after treatment, pres can still contain low levels of various pollutants potentially toxic to organisms. earlier work, including whole-effluent toxicity assessments, has shown that the toxicity of permitted pres is often limited. however, the extent to which pres contribute to chemical pollution already present in the receiving environment is unknown. therefore, our study aimed to assess the contribution of pres to mixture toxic pressure in the environment, using the multi-substance potentially affected fraction of species (mspaf) as an indicator. based on measured chemical concentrations, compiled species sensitivity distributions (ssd) and a mechanistic solubility model, mspaf levels were estimated for undiluted effluents at discharge points and diluted effluents downstream in receiving waters. median mspaf-chronic and mspaf-acute levels of pres at discharge points were 74% (p50) and 40% (p95), respectively. the calculated mspaf levels were reduced substantially to <5% downstream for most effluents (82%), indicating low to negligible toxicity of pres in receiving environments beyond the initial mixing zone. regardless of differences in endpoints and locations, hydrocarbons (mainly total petroleum hydrocarbons) and inorganics (mainly ammonia) explained at least 85% of the mixture toxic pressure. the mspaf levels of pres were on average 2.5–4.5 orders of magnitude lower than mspaf levels derived from background pollution levels, suggesting that pres were minor contributors to the toxic pressure in the environment. this study presents a generic methodology for quantifying the potential toxic pressure of pres in the environment, identifying hotspots where more effective wastewater treatment could be needed. we explicitly discuss the uncertainties for further refinement and development of the method. © 2022 the authors"

the weathering process of polyethylene microplastics in the paddy soil system: does the coexistence of pyrochar or hydrochar matter?,"this study is based on a particular test site to simulate the weathering process of microplastics (mps) in paddy soil. a substantial amount of plastic waste, especially mps, inevitably accumulates in agricultural soil due to the high consumption and short average use of plastics. recently, mp pollution has become a global environmental concern. however, insight into the soil weathering process of mps in paddy soil, particularly in the presence of biochar, is lacking. in this study, the physicochemical properties of polyethylene (pe) mps were determined through a 24-week weathering system conducted in paddy soil, paddy soil with pyrochar, or hydrochar. moreover, the sorption of original and weathered pe mps toward three typical pollutants (cadmium/cd, bisphenol a/bpa, and dimethyl phthalate/dmp) was investigated. the surface of pe mps was fractured, 1.1-fold rougher, yellow-colored (11.7 units), and 1.8-fold more oxidized after paddy soil weathering. in addition, the crystallinity, negative charge, and stronger hydrophilicity of weathered pe mps increased compared to original pe mps. weathering in a pyrochar or hydrochar system caused fissures, extensive destruction of amorphous areas, and accelerated chemical or bio-oxidation processes for pe mps, resulting in a more noticeable change in roughness (1.4–2.2-fold), yellow color (12.7–13.7), crystallinity (1.2–1.5-fold), and oxygen content (2.5–3.6-fold). weathered pe mps facilitated the sorption with cd and bpa, attributed to larger specific surface area, abundant polar functional groups, and increased negatively charged sites. however, sorption of dmp to pe mps was highly influenced by their hydrophobicity, resulting in decreased hydrophobic partition sorption on weathered pe mps. overall, paddy soil weathering affected the properties of pe mps and enhanced sorption of cd and bpa but reduced sorption of dmp. the coexistence of biochar exacerbated the paddy soil weathering effect. the insight gained from this study assists in better understanding the weathering process of pe mps in agricultural soils. © 2022 elsevier ltd",soil,0,"the weathering process of polyethylene microplastics in the paddy soil system: does the coexistence of pyrochar or hydrochar matter? this study is based on a particular test site to simulate the weathering process of microplastics (mps) in paddy soil. a substantial amount of plastic waste, especially mps, inevitably accumulates in agricultural soil due to the high consumption and short average use of plastics. recently, mp pollution has become a global environmental concern. however, insight into the soil weathering process of mps in paddy soil, particularly in the presence of biochar, is lacking. in this study, the physicochemical properties of polyethylene (pe) mps were determined through a 24-week weathering system conducted in paddy soil, paddy soil with pyrochar, or hydrochar. moreover, the sorption of original and weathered pe mps toward three typical pollutants (cadmium/cd, bisphenol a/bpa, and dimethyl phthalate/dmp) was investigated. the surface of pe mps was fractured, 1.1-fold rougher, yellow-colored (11.7 units), and 1.8-fold more oxidized after paddy soil weathering. in addition, the crystallinity, negative charge, and stronger hydrophilicity of weathered pe mps increased compared to original pe mps. weathering in a pyrochar or hydrochar system caused fissures, extensive destruction of amorphous areas, and accelerated chemical or bio-oxidation processes for pe mps, resulting in a more noticeable change in roughness (1.4–2.2-fold), yellow color (12.7–13.7), crystallinity (1.2–1.5-fold), and oxygen content (2.5–3.6-fold). weathered pe mps facilitated the sorption with cd and bpa, attributed to larger specific surface area, abundant polar functional groups, and increased negatively charged sites. however, sorption of dmp to pe mps was highly influenced by their hydrophobicity, resulting in decreased hydrophobic partition sorption on weathered pe mps. overall, paddy soil weathering affected the properties of pe mps and enhanced sorption of cd and bpa but reduced sorption of dmp. the coexistence of biochar exacerbated the paddy soil weathering effect. the insight gained from this study assists in better understanding the weathering process of pe mps in agricultural soils. © 2022 elsevier ltd"

influence of citrate/tartrate on chromite crystallization behavior and its potential environmental implications,"the ferrite process has been developed to purify wastewater containing heavy metal ions and recycle valuable metals by forming chromium ferrite. however, organic matter has an important influence on the crystallization behavior and stability of chromite synthesized from chromium-containing wastewater. we focused on the influence and effect mechanism of two typical organic acid salts (citrate (ca) and tartrate (ta)) on the process of chromium mineralization. it was found that the presence of organic matter leads to the increase of the residual content of cr in ca system (0.50 mmol/l) and ta system (0.61 mmol/l) in the solution, and the removal of chromium was mainly due to the surface adsorption of fe(iii) hydrolysate. the decreased crystallinity of mineralized products is ascribed to the completion of organic compounds with fe(ii) and fe(iii), which hinders the formation of ferrite precursors. there was bidentate and monodentate chelation between -coo- and metal ions in the ca system and ta system respectively, which resulted in a stronger affinity between ca and iron. this study provides the underlying mechanism for cr(iii) solid oxidation by the ferrite method in an organic matter environment and is of great significance to prevent and control chromium pollution in the environment. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",water,1,"influence of citrate/tartrate on chromite crystallization behavior and its potential environmental implications the ferrite process has been developed to purify wastewater containing heavy metal ions and recycle valuable metals by forming chromium ferrite. however, organic matter has an important influence on the crystallization behavior and stability of chromite synthesized from chromium-containing wastewater. we focused on the influence and effect mechanism of two typical organic acid salts (citrate (ca) and tartrate (ta)) on the process of chromium mineralization. it was found that the presence of organic matter leads to the increase of the residual content of cr in ca system (0.50 mmol/l) and ta system (0.61 mmol/l) in the solution, and the removal of chromium was mainly due to the surface adsorption of fe(iii) hydrolysate. the decreased crystallinity of mineralized products is ascribed to the completion of organic compounds with fe(ii) and fe(iii), which hinders the formation of ferrite precursors. there was bidentate and monodentate chelation between -coo- and metal ions in the ca system and ta system respectively, which resulted in a stronger affinity between ca and iron. this study provides the underlying mechanism for cr(iii) solid oxidation by the ferrite method in an organic matter environment and is of great significance to prevent and control chromium pollution in the environment. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
adsorptive removal of aromatic diamines from water using metal-organic frameworks functionalized with a nitro group,"adsorptive removal of aromatic diamines such as methylenedianiline (mda) and p-phenylenediamine (ppd) was firstly investigated with nitro-functionalized metal-organic frameworks (mofs, mil-101(cr)-no2). the mil-101(cr)-no2 showed much better performances in the removal of mda and ppd, in both adsorption capacity and kinetics, than any other adsorbents. for example, mil-101(cr)-no2 had a much higher maximum adsorption capacity for mda (1111 mg·g−1) than activated carbon (208 mg·g−1) or a reported adsorbent (391 mg·g−1). based on experimental results, hydrogen bonding (especially, via the formation of a 6-membered ring (6-mr) between -no2 of the adsorbent and -nh2 of the adsorbates) could be suggested as the main mechanism to interpret the noticeable adsorption of the diamines. importantly, this is the first example to confirm that mofs with nitro group can be a competitive adsorbent to remove organics composed of amino group, especially via making 6-mr through hydrogen bonding. higher adsorption of mda than that of ppd over mil-101(cr)-no2 might be explained with π-π interaction between aromatic rings (π-lean aromatics of mof and π-rich aromatics of the adsorbates). moreover, mil-101(cr)-no2 could be recycled after simple washing, suggesting the potential use of the mof in adsorptive purification of contaminated water with organics with amino groups. © 2022 elsevier b.v.",water,1,"adsorptive removal of aromatic diamines from water using metal-organic frameworks functionalized with a nitro group adsorptive removal of aromatic diamines such as methylenedianiline (mda) and p-phenylenediamine (ppd) was firstly investigated with nitro-functionalized metal-organic frameworks (mofs, mil-101(cr)-no2). the mil-101(cr)-no2 showed much better performances in the removal of mda and ppd, in both adsorption capacity and kinetics, than any other adsorbents. for example, mil-101(cr)-no2 had a much higher maximum adsorption capacity for mda (1111 mg·g−1) than activated carbon (208 mg·g−1) or a reported adsorbent (391 mg·g−1). based on experimental results, hydrogen bonding (especially, via the formation of a 6-membered ring (6-mr) between -no2 of the adsorbent and -nh2 of the adsorbates) could be suggested as the main mechanism to interpret the noticeable adsorption of the diamines. importantly, this is the first example to confirm that mofs with nitro group can be a competitive adsorbent to remove organics composed of amino group, especially via making 6-mr through hydrogen bonding. higher adsorption of mda than that of ppd over mil-101(cr)-no2 might be explained with π-π interaction between aromatic rings (π-lean aromatics of mof and π-rich aromatics of the adsorbates). moreover, mil-101(cr)-no2 could be recycled after simple washing, suggesting the potential use of the mof in adsorptive purification of contaminated water with organics with amino groups. © 2022 elsevier b.v."

aerosol emissions from a marine diesel engine running on different fuels and effects of exhaust gas cleaning measures,"the emissions of marine diesel engines have gained both global and regional attentions because of their impact on human health and climate change. to reduce ship emissions, the international maritime organization capped the fuel sulfur content of marine fuels. consequently, either low-sulfur fuels or additional exhaust gas cleaning devices for the reduction in sulfur dioxide (so2) emissions became mandatory. although a wet scrubber reduces the amount of so2 significantly, there is still a need to consider the reduction in particle emissions directly. we present data on the particle removal efficiency of a scrubber regarding particle number and mass concentration with different marine fuel types, marine gas oil, and two heavy fuel oils (hfos). an open-loop sulfur scrubber was installed in the exhaust line of a marine diesel test engine. fine particulate matter was comprehensively characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties. the wet scrubber led up to a 40% reduction in particle number, whereas a reduction in particle mass emissions was not generally determined. we observed a shift in the size distribution by the scrubber to larger particle diameters when the engine was operated on conventional hfos. the reduction in particle number concentrations and shift in particle size were caused by the coagulation of soot particles and formation/growing of sulfur-containing particles. combining the scrubber with a wet electrostatic precipitator as an additional abatement system showed a reduction in particle number and mass emission factors by &gt;98%. therefore, the application of a wet scrubber for the after-treatment of marine fuel oil combustion will reduce so2 emissions, but it does not substantially affect the number and mass concentration of respirable particulate matters. to reduce particle emission, the scrubber should be combined with additional abatement systems. © 2022 elsevier ltd",air,2,"aerosol emissions from a marine diesel engine running on different fuels and effects of exhaust gas cleaning measures the emissions of marine diesel engines have gained both global and regional attentions because of their impact on human health and climate change. to reduce ship emissions, the international maritime organization capped the fuel sulfur content of marine fuels. consequently, either low-sulfur fuels or additional exhaust gas cleaning devices for the reduction in sulfur dioxide (so2) emissions became mandatory. although a wet scrubber reduces the amount of so2 significantly, there is still a need to consider the reduction in particle emissions directly. we present data on the particle removal efficiency of a scrubber regarding particle number and mass concentration with different marine fuel types, marine gas oil, and two heavy fuel oils (hfos). an open-loop sulfur scrubber was installed in the exhaust line of a marine diesel test engine. fine particulate matter was comprehensively characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties. the wet scrubber led up to a 40% reduction in particle number, whereas a reduction in particle mass emissions was not generally determined. we observed a shift in the size distribution by the scrubber to larger particle diameters when the engine was operated on conventional hfos. the reduction in particle number concentrations and shift in particle size were caused by the coagulation of soot particles and formation/growing of sulfur-containing particles. combining the scrubber with a wet electrostatic precipitator as an additional abatement system showed a reduction in particle number and mass emission factors by &gt;98%. therefore, the application of a wet scrubber for the after-treatment of marine fuel oil combustion will reduce so2 emissions, but it does not substantially affect the number and mass concentration of respirable particulate matters. to reduce particle emission, the scrubber should be combined with additional abatement systems. © 2022 elsevier ltd"

biodiesel feedstock determines exhaust toxicity in 20% biodiesel: 80% mineral diesel blends,"to address climate change concerns, and reduce the carbon footprint caused by fossil fuel use, it is likely that blend ratios of renewable biodiesel with commercial mineral diesel fuel will steadily increase, resulting in biodiesel use becoming more widespread. exhaust toxicity of unblended biodiesels changes depending on feedstock type, however the effect of feedstock on blended fuels is less well known. the aim of this study was to assess the impact of biodiesel feedstock on exhaust toxicity of 20% blended biodiesel fuels (b20). primary human airway epithelial cells were exposed to exhaust diluted 1/15 with air from an engine running on conventional ultra-low sulfur diesel (ulsd) or 20% blends of soy, canola, waste cooking oil (wco), tallow, palm or cottonseed biodiesel in diesel. physico-chemical exhaust properties were compared between fuels and the post-exposure effect of exhaust on cellular viability and media release was assessed 24 h later. exhaust properties changed significantly between all fuels with cottonseed b20 being the most different to both ulsd and its respective unblended biodiesel. exposure to palm b20 resulted in significantly decreased cellular viability (96.3 ± 1.7%; p < 0.01) whereas exposure to soy b20 generated the greatest number of changes in mediator release (including il-6, il-8 and tnf-α, p < 0.05) when compared to air exposed controls, with palm b20 and tallow b20 closely following. in contrast, canola b20 and wco b20 were the least toxic with only mediators g-csf and tnf-α being significantly increased. therefore, exposure to palm b20, soy b20 and tallow b20 were found to be the most toxic and exposure to canola b20 and wco b20 the least. the top three most toxic and the bottom three least toxic b20 fuels are consistent with their unblended counterparts, suggesting that feedstock type greatly impacts exhaust toxicity, even when biodiesel only comprises 20% of the fuel. © 2022 elsevier ltd",air,2,"biodiesel feedstock determines exhaust toxicity in 20% biodiesel: 80% mineral diesel blends to address climate change concerns, and reduce the carbon footprint caused by fossil fuel use, it is likely that blend ratios of renewable biodiesel with commercial mineral diesel fuel will steadily increase, resulting in biodiesel use becoming more widespread. exhaust toxicity of unblended biodiesels changes depending on feedstock type, however the effect of feedstock on blended fuels is less well known. the aim of this study was to assess the impact of biodiesel feedstock on exhaust toxicity of 20% blended biodiesel fuels (b20). primary human airway epithelial cells were exposed to exhaust diluted 1/15 with air from an engine running on conventional ultra-low sulfur diesel (ulsd) or 20% blends of soy, canola, waste cooking oil (wco), tallow, palm or cottonseed biodiesel in diesel. physico-chemical exhaust properties were compared between fuels and the post-exposure effect of exhaust on cellular viability and media release was assessed 24 h later. exhaust properties changed significantly between all fuels with cottonseed b20 being the most different to both ulsd and its respective unblended biodiesel. exposure to palm b20 resulted in significantly decreased cellular viability (96.3 ± 1.7%; p < 0.01) whereas exposure to soy b20 generated the greatest number of changes in mediator release (including il-6, il-8 and tnf-α, p < 0.05) when compared to air exposed controls, with palm b20 and tallow b20 closely following. in contrast, canola b20 and wco b20 were the least toxic with only mediators g-csf and tnf-α being significantly increased. therefore, exposure to palm b20, soy b20 and tallow b20 were found to be the most toxic and exposure to canola b20 and wco b20 the least. the top three most toxic and the bottom three least toxic b20 fuels are consistent with their unblended counterparts, suggesting that feedstock type greatly impacts exhaust toxicity, even when biodiesel only comprises 20% of the fuel. © 2022 elsevier ltd"

synthesis of lichen response to gaseous nitrogen: ammonia versus nitrogen dioxide,"the dominant chemical form of nitrogen pollution in the atmosphere in the u.s. is shifting from oxidized nitrogen, primarily from combustion of fossil fuels, to reduced nitrogen from agricultural animal waste and fertilizer applications. does it matter to lichens? in this synthesis, we characterize u.s. air concentrations of the most ubiquitous gaseous forms of reduced and oxidized nitrogen, no2 and nh3, respectively, and their direct effects on lichens. in the u.s., the 3-year average (2017–2019) of the annual mean for each monitoring site ranges up to 56.4 μg no2 m−3 (∼30 ppb) and 6 μg nh3 m−3 (∼9 ppb). the spatial coverage of current routine monitoring of no2 and nh3 likely does not accurately represent exposures of no2 to ecosystems in rural areas or capture spikes of nh3 concentrations proximal to intensive agriculture, which are documented to exceed 700 μg nh3 m−3 (∼1000 ppb) for short durations. both no2 and nh3 can act as nutrients to lichens, but as exposures rise, both can cause physiological stress and mortality that then change community composition and diversity. there is a growing body of evidence that lichen community composition is altered at current levels of exposure in the u.s. with estimated no effect or lowest effect concentrations from &lt;1 to 3 μg m−3 no2 and &lt;1 μg m−3 nh3. better spatial characterization of both no2 and nh3 concentrations, especially near intensive agriculture, would help to characterize the extent of the impacts across the u.s. these findings are discussed in the context of u.s. air pollution policy. © 2022",air,2,"synthesis of lichen response to gaseous nitrogen: ammonia versus nitrogen dioxide the dominant chemical form of nitrogen pollution in the atmosphere in the u.s. is shifting from oxidized nitrogen, primarily from combustion of fossil fuels, to reduced nitrogen from agricultural animal waste and fertilizer applications. does it matter to lichens? in this synthesis, we characterize u.s. air concentrations of the most ubiquitous gaseous forms of reduced and oxidized nitrogen, no2 and nh3, respectively, and their direct effects on lichens. in the u.s., the 3-year average (2017–2019) of the annual mean for each monitoring site ranges up to 56.4 μg no2 m−3 (∼30 ppb) and 6 μg nh3 m−3 (∼9 ppb). the spatial coverage of current routine monitoring of no2 and nh3 likely does not accurately represent exposures of no2 to ecosystems in rural areas or capture spikes of nh3 concentrations proximal to intensive agriculture, which are documented to exceed 700 μg nh3 m−3 (∼1000 ppb) for short durations. both no2 and nh3 can act as nutrients to lichens, but as exposures rise, both can cause physiological stress and mortality that then change community composition and diversity. there is a growing body of evidence that lichen community composition is altered at current levels of exposure in the u.s. with estimated no effect or lowest effect concentrations from &lt;1 to 3 μg m−3 no2 and &lt;1 μg m−3 nh3. better spatial characterization of both no2 and nh3 concentrations, especially near intensive agriculture, would help to characterize the extent of the impacts across the u.s. these findings are discussed in the context of u.s. air pollution policy. © 2022"
plant-air partition coefficients for thirteen urban conifer tree species: estimating the best gas and particulate matter associated pah removers,"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are an important class of pollutants which mostly come out from incomplete combustion of organic materials including fossil fuels. for this reason, they are often found at high concentrations in cities, contaminating air with their gas and particle phase. while european union policies try to reduce their concentrations, huge efforts are still devoted to mitigate the pollution by pahs. one such measure of mitigation is the use of plants in capturing pahs and other chemicals due to the ability of leaves in filtering both gas and particle fractions. in this work thirteen conifer species among those frequently living in temperate and mediterranean cities were selected and concentrations of 16 pahs were measured in needles. the data for spruce were used to back-calculate air concentrations of pahs which were later used to obtain specific equations of plant-air partition coefficient (kpa). the results showed that the difference in total pah uptake between the most (pinus pinaster) and the least (picea abies) efficient tree was close to an order of magnitude. looking to the capability of the different species in enriching the particulate matter (pm) associated fraction of pahs on their needles, pinus pinaster was instead the least important (3.4% of total pahs), while cupressus lusitanica was the most important (34% of total pahs). the new kpa equations can be used to fine tune the pah uptake of a specific amount of plant biomass on air concentration reduction. © 2022 elsevier ltd",air,2,"plant-air partition coefficients for thirteen urban conifer tree species: estimating the best gas and particulate matter associated pah removers polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are an important class of pollutants which mostly come out from incomplete combustion of organic materials including fossil fuels. for this reason, they are often found at high concentrations in cities, contaminating air with their gas and particle phase. while european union policies try to reduce their concentrations, huge efforts are still devoted to mitigate the pollution by pahs. one such measure of mitigation is the use of plants in capturing pahs and other chemicals due to the ability of leaves in filtering both gas and particle fractions. in this work thirteen conifer species among those frequently living in temperate and mediterranean cities were selected and concentrations of 16 pahs were measured in needles. the data for spruce were used to back-calculate air concentrations of pahs which were later used to obtain specific equations of plant-air partition coefficient (kpa). the results showed that the difference in total pah uptake between the most (pinus pinaster) and the least (picea abies) efficient tree was close to an order of magnitude. looking to the capability of the different species in enriching the particulate matter (pm) associated fraction of pahs on their needles, pinus pinaster was instead the least important (3.4% of total pahs), while cupressus lusitanica was the most important (34% of total pahs). the new kpa equations can be used to fine tune the pah uptake of a specific amount of plant biomass on air concentration reduction. © 2022 elsevier ltd"
